<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This was the eighth edition of the <a href="https://www.core-crew.com/tatonka-5-10k-run">Tatonka 5k "Fun
Run"</a>. This was my second
time running it.  I only learned about it last year.</p>

<p>Declan, Matthew's son, turned eight today, but couldn't be here. He
lives back east.  So, pre-race, his grandmother led the crowd, singing
Happy Birthday, which was recorded and sent to him.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, Declan!</p>
<p>Matthew's mother and brother run this event, and they're supported by
amazing volunteers, including JROTC students from the local high schools.</p>
<p>In addition to it being a celebration of Matthew's life, this run is a
fundraiser for the <a href="https://greenberetfoundation.org/">Green Beret Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre Race</a></h2>
<p>Once again, my buddy Don was there and although I remembered his name,
I had forgotten that <em>this</em> Don was <strong>the same</strong> Don who taught
Physics at <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/">USMA</a>, which is where Iris,
one of our (my wife's and my) twin daughters is going to school. Don
introduced me to Amy, who was to take first in the female 50-100 age
group.</p>
<p>There are only two age groups: 10-49 and 50-100<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Pre-race I ran
into my friend
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=George&amp;lname=Sefzik">George</a>
and his son George.  George is 48, while George is 18. I don't
remember George's father's age, but I do remember his name:
George. That George, i.e., George's father, was a liaison (I <em>think</em>
that's the name of the position) for high school students who apply to
USMA. George himself, went to the Air Force Academy. His son, George,
goes to UNM, which is where Margaret—our other twin daughter—is
enrolled.</p>
<p>After readying my ruck (there's no separate rucksack division; I
just use this race to help me ease into my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March#bataan-memorial-death-march-training">Bataan Memorial Death
March
training</a>),
I hung out with Don and Amy as we all sang (at least those of us who
weren't too choked up) Happy Birthday to Declan. The color guard and National
Anthem were next. After a description of the course, we
started promptly at 10am.</p>
<h2 id="the-race"><a class="header" href="#the-race">The Race</a></h2>
<p>Like <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/past/2022/tatonka_5k.html#the-race">last
year</a>,
the race was held in the <a href="https://nmvetsmemorial.org/">New
Mexico Veterans Memorial</a>. This year,
however it was much more twisty, because it was basically two 1.55
mile loops as opposed to last year when it was approximately three
1.16 mile loops<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This year, a combination of a foot injury and a rib injury kept me
from running, much less running with a pack, for the last several
months.  As such, I knew I was out of shape, so I pulled out all the
stops.  I had a double espresso a little more than a half hour before
the race started; I wore my ice hat filled with ice and I carried two
hand-helds, each filled with ice water.</p>
<p>My goal was to not go out too quickly, but to rev my heart up to
around 160 beats per minute and hold it there.  If there were people
to pass or people to prevent from passing while I was up in my
redline, I'd try my best, but nope. Sadie came in 26th, in 29:29.6.
Eighteen seconds later I finished at <a href="https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=332932&amp;did=415087">27th in
29:47.7</a>
and I didn't see Erin in back of me, but she finished less than seven
seconds after I did, in 28th at 29:54.5.</p>
<p>I'm happy that I was able to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/10079475107">rev up my heart rate and keep it
up</a>. I'm realistic
enough to not be surprised that I was 38 seconds per mile slower this
year even though my average heart rate was 4 beats per minute
faster. Fitness is a thing, and I've lost a bunch.</p>
<h2 id="post-race"><a class="header" href="#post-race">Post Race</a></h2>
<p>This year I drank my rice milk and ate my recovery <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt">fortified
oatmeal</a>
<em>before</em> drinking my <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24659/67709/">celebratory
beer</a>. I took
a few photos as Amy and George took first in their (age, sex)
divisions and chuckled as the announcer wasn't completely sure what
was going on with George Sefzik taking first and George J. Sefzik
taking fourth. I suggested that cheating might be involved.</p>
<p>It was a largely unknown event held in a largely unknown venue. And
yet… it's growing.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I hugged mom McClintock and tried to speak.</p>
<br/>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I plan to keep doing this for forty one more years, just to
cause them trouble when I'm 101. Thinking of you,

<p>Yup, last year's course was a little long, but this year's was just right.</p>
