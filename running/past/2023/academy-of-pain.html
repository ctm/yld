<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1768138600253055/?active_tab=about">Academy of
Pain</a>
is a timed event, where people run loops around the Albuquerque
Academy for up to twelve hours.  It is put on by <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Julie&amp;lname=Tertin">Julie
Tertin</a>
and her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/4644160398992755/">Albuquerque Trail Running
Crew</a>. This may
seem like a dumb thing to do, and that's what it's billed as and
that's what people want.  See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1768138600253055/?active_tab=discussion">the discussion

<h2 id="the-conflict"><a class="header" href="#the-conflict">The Conflict</a></h2>
<p>This year AoP was held as the same day as the <a href="brew-crowning.html">Burque Brew Tour
Crowning</a>.  The Brew Tour has been held since 2014.
AoP premiered last year (2022). There's not—<i>yet</i>—a huge
overlap between the people who attend AoP and the Brew Tour, but I'm
one of them and that left me with a dilemma.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-both"><a class="header" href="#why-not-both">Why Not Both?</a></h3>
<p>The rules for many, if not most, timed running events are that you can leave
the course any time you want, as long as you return to where you left, but
when you're not on course, your miles don't count.</p>
<p>Since the BBTC race was
only 3.8 miles, I could have done AA laps, then drove down to Bomb's Away,
run the BBTC, drove back and resumed where I had left off, but that make it
hard for me to run an easy fifty AoP miles, due to the timing.  It would also
curtail my socializing at BBTC. So, I chose to run from AoP to BBTC, run the
BBTC race, then run up, and then continue to run AoP.</p>
<p>Sheepishly, I explained my plan to Julie in advance and asked her
whether she'd count my miles outside the Albuquerque Academy perimeter
as AoP miles.  I would be happy whatever her decision was, because
she's the race director and RDs have to balance a lot more than can be
seen from the outside.</p>
<p>Reasons to not allow extra-curricular miles involve the difference in
elevation change, the ability of a participant to cheat, the
difference between whole loops (a loop is 3.3 miles at minimum) and
mere mileage and the degradation of the social experience. Luckily,
Julie granted my dispensation, so now it was just an exercise in
logistics.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a class="header" href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>For me, running a slow 50 miles requires water and probably calories.  I'll
also need to use a restroom once or twice.  Although not strictly necessary,
having a plan for where I'll run which miles will put my mind at ease, so
I drew up this one:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th style="text-align: right">Total</th><th style="text-align: right">New</th><th>What</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0600</td><td style="text-align: right"></td><td style="text-align: right">11.55</td><td>3.5 AA laps</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>Water was easy. I have a seven gallon water jug I keep in my truck (along
with the lugaloo).  I have a running belt that holds two six ounce water
bottles.  It'll be sufficiently cool that I can drink water between AA laps
and use my the water bottles in my running belt to get me to Bombs Away,
where they can be refilled for my trip back.</p>
<p>Food was easy too, sort-of.  These events are done in a semi pot-luck
fashion.  You bring more of what you have than you plan to eat and you
share what you have with others.  I had a big box of leftovers from
the <a href="foothills_fat_ass.html">Foothills Fat Ass</a>, but it was at my mother's
house, where my sister and I have taken over her den to use as storage.
I didn't pick up the box until pretty close to race day, and then I saw
that all that remained were things that required hot water (e.g. instant
oatmeal, coffee).</p>
<p>I new it would be chilly, so I figured I'd simply bring that box of stuff,
two thermoses filled with boiling water and two stoves (a small JetBoil that
heats a single serving very quickly and a larger propane stove that can
heat an entire pan).  People could immediately use the water from a thermos,
and if they wanted to kill time and replenish it from a stove, great!  If
not, oh well, it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>I also brought a big baggie of various gels and a large package of
Jolly Rancher hard candies.</p>
<p>I made a bunch of double espressos and laid out my clothes and
electronics.  I created a surprisingly large pile of things in the
front-hall, including our thermoses, the stoves and fuel.</p>
<h2 id="race-day"><a class="header" href="#race-day">Race Day</a></h2>
<p>I woke up at 5, weighed myself, ate a serving of oatmeal and started
boiling water for the thermoses.  It seemed like I had all the time in
the world, so I also decided to make myself another serving of
fortified oatmeal.  I got distracted and of course water boiled all
over the place.  Time ticked away.</p>
<p>It took me many trips to load everything into the truck.  Our front door
doesn't work, so I have to go out the back door and around the side of
the house.  Time ticked away.</p>
<p>I drove the five minutes to the Cherry Hills Library parking lot and
was about to start schlepping things the short distance (albeit with a
traffic light in between) to the staging area when I saw people were
running.  I glanced at my watch and sure enough, it was 6am.</p>
<p>So, gang aft agley, I left everything in the back of the truck and
ran.</p>
<p>I caught up with Julie, Dustin and a few others.  They were headed
counter-clockwise, so very briefly I was following my plan.</p>
<h3 id="initial-loops"><a class="header" href="#initial-loops">Initial &quot;loops&quot;</a></h3>
<p>It was fun to run and chat with others.  I got to hear a little bit
about what people had done since I saw them last and what was
upcoming.  I was surprised to see my friend David, because all of his
Strava tracks for what seemed like an eternity, were from Australia.
I thought he might have moved down there, but it was only a six week
relocation.</p>
<p>People were running faster than I had thought I'd run, which meant
that if did &quot;washing-machine&quot; loops (i.e., alternating between
counter-clockwise and clockwise), I would be at the corner of Wyoming
and Academy well before 8:30. With that in mind, I decided that since
my running was going to be mileage based rather than loop based, I'd
opportunistically switch directions to link up with other groups of
runners.  This way I also got to spend some time with Geoff and Jan.</p>
<h3 id="to-bombs-away"><a class="header" href="#to-bombs-away">To Bombs Away</a></h3>
<p>At 8:27 I headed south on Wyoming, five and a half miles south to
Central.  After a couple of turns I was at Bombs Away.  I got there
with plenty of time, which meant I spent a little time chatting with
people (especially Perky &amp; Prince Charming) and maybe a little time
running back and forth to accrue some &quot;buffer&quot; mileage.</p>
<p>Ten AM rolled around and we were off.  My initial plan was to run at
a leisurely pace, but it seemed like I could finish as first male without
having to red-line it, so <a href="brew-crowning.html">I did</a>.</p>
<h3 id="post-bbtc"><a class="header" href="#post-bbtc">Post BBTC</a></h3>
<p>After crossing the finish line, I headed back up the course to run in with
Dennis, then I turned around and headed back out again so I could run/walk
in with his wife Glenda.  This gave me a little extra mileage, a little
extra tine to chat with them and also kept them in my sights so I could
hand them the ticket for the free beer I won by being first male.  I <em>think</em>
we're even on beers now.  They bought me two beers after the <a href="../2022/black_friday.html">Black Friday
Turkey Trots</a>, and I was able to win a beer at
V-Day and another here at the Crowning.</p>
<p>Eventually I went inside to briefly socialize and scarf two small bags
of popcorn (probably not vegan due to the butter flavor), taking a
third for the road. At 11:30 I bade au revoir and started running back
up to Albuquerque Academy.  This time I had something to do when I had to
stop at stoplights: eat popcorn.</p>
<p>I got to my truck and used the water from the least efficient thermos (not
actually a real Thermos) to heat up four servings of instant oatmeal.  I
also ate three caffeinated gels and drank a double espresso before grabbing
a handful of Jolly Rancher hard candies and heading over to the trash can.
I deposited the oatmeal wrappers and an empty potato chip wrapper, then
peeled each of the Jolly Ranchers before stuffing them into my mouth.</p>
<p>I temporarily put my Albuquerque Road Runners crop top back on so I
could use the library's facilities, then took it off, put it back in
my truck, double checked that my truck keys were in a zippered pocket
that I had zippered shut<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and headed out for more fun.</p>
<h2 id="final-loops"><a class="header" href="#final-loops">Final &quot;loops&quot;</a></h2>
<p>I had done 32 miles now, which meant if did five more loops I would be
about a mile and a half shy of fifty miles.  I had plenty of time to
figure out a plan.  By now there weren't nearly as many people on the
course as there had been in the morning.  It also wasn't clear exactly
who was part of the event. As such, I cranked out loops washing
machine style, saying hi to the lovebirds as I passed.</p>
<p>As I was finishing my post-BBTC fifth AA lap, I looked at the time and
decided I did not want to run quickly enough to do an entire sixth
lap.  I had seen Julie, Dustin and their dog doing a clockwise lap
while I was going counter-clockwise, so I decided I'd simply keep
going counter clockwise past where I'd normally change directions, run
into them, head to the finish with them and then do whatever short
out-and-back I'd need to get my fifty.</p>
<p>Like many of my other AoP plans, that didn't happen. I did indeed
continue going around counter-clockwise, but I didn't see the trio, so
when I was about a mile from the start/finish with forty-nine miles on
my feet I turned around and finished up. Luckily they were there so I
got to thank them (but not nearly enough!), before grabbing my stuff,
walking over to my truck and turning off my GPS sports watch.</p>
<h2 id="fear-itself"><a class="header" href="#fear-itself">Fear Itself</a></h2>
<p>I very much looked forward to the Academy of Pain this year because I
saw it as a test to see how well my right foot would hold up.</p>
<p>I developed a hot-spot in my foot after running the <a href="../2022/dptr_106m.html">Deadman Peaks 106
miler</a> six days after running the <a href="../2022/jj100.html">Javelina
Jundred</a>.  My training for the Bataan Memorial Death
March further aggravated my hot-spot and so I bit the bullet and had a
shot of cortisone on March 10th (which was the day before the <a href="king-of-the-hill.html">King of
the Hill 10k ruck</a>, nine days before the <a href="bmdm.html">Bataan
Memorial Death March</a> and sixteen days before the Academy of
Pain).</p>
<p>Wanting to run the Cocodona 250 in 2023, I figured if I couldn't run
an easy fifty miles at AoP, I had no business even considering C250.
I'm happy with my performance and will now see if I can muster the
resources to enter.</p>
<p>Thank you, Julie!</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Last year I lost my truck keys in the Cherry Hills Library
parking lot after doing an AA lap with my pack.  It wasn't during
Academy of Pain, but it was the same truck in the same parking lot and
hence it was a painful memory.  Speaking of painful memories, I still
remember the time at the Cedro Peak 50k that I patted myself on the
back for remembering to put my keys in a zippered pocket only to
forget to actually close the pocket.  Of course they fell out. Luckily,
my sister was able to find them for me.  Thanks, Marcia!</p>
