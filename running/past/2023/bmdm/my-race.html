4:40:41.221</a>. I
finished second in
<a href="https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2023/115251/2017">4:41:03.683</a>,
a 22.462 second difference.</p>
<h3 id="coulda--shoulda-woulda"><a class="header" href="#coulda--shoulda-woulda">Coulda,  Shoulda, Woulda</a></h3>
<p>I could have run faster. I should have run faster and had I known I
was as close to my PR
(<a href="https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524">4:39:45.185</a>)
as I was, I would have run faster, even without knowing that it would
have made the difference between first and second.</p>
<p>I didn't run as fast I could have for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A runner with what looked like a pack with a plate in it passed me
with sufficient speed and grace that I figured I was not going to
finish first this year with my gimpy foot. As he passed me, I shouted
to him &quot;Do you have a plate in there?&quot; and he just smiled.  My guess
is he didn't actually hear me.  He had earbuds in. I did catch up with
him during lunch, afterward and nope, no plate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew that six days after BMDM was going to be the <a href="../academy-of-pain.html">Academy of
Pain</a>, a twelve hour timed race that I wanted
to run at least fifty miles during. I had run that distance in the
same event last year and this year I was on the fence as to whether my
foot would hold up well enough to justify signing up for the <a href="https://cocodona.com/">Cocoona
250</a> and I figured AoP would be an excellent
test. I really wanted to sign up for C250, so I justified not running
harder in order to not jeopardize that test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running hard that late in the race is annoyingly uncomfortable.  I can do
it, but let's face it, I looked for—and found—reasons not to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At lunch I asked Zachary point blank if I had caught up to him would he
have put up a fight and his answer was no.  I had passed him going up
mineral hill, but he saw my backpack outside a porta-potty and deliberately
chose to run as quickly as he could to gain as much of a lead as possible.
That was quite successful, because my hubris lead me to believe that I had
crushed his spirit and it didn't occur to me that he had passed me during
my brief pit stop. The downside to Zachary is that by his own admission
he blew up and that's why, had I run faster, he didn't think he'd have
been able to put up a fight.</p>

<p>&quot;Last year&quot; was 2019, because BMDM hadn't been held in person since then.</p>
<p>I was in the best shape ever and we had perfect weather.
Unfortunately, I developed debilitating hip pain that was almost
definitely due to my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2019.md#wah-wah-wah-my-pack-broke">pack
breaking</a>.
I did not see or hear my pack break, but my pack was definitely broken
by the time I picked it up after taking it off and crossing the finish
line.</p>
<h3 id="this-years-training"><a class="header" href="#this-years-training">This Year's Training</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2023.md#past">This year's
training</a>
did not go well.  I started out with a hot-spot in my right foot and
training with a pack made it worse.  Each training year I do one or
two twenty-four mile trainings and, in general, those are good
predictors for my performance.  However, in 2019 I didn't do as well
as predicted, presumably due to the broken pack. This year, I did
*<strong>much</strong> better than predicted, because both of my twenty-four mile
trainings were marred by foot pain that wasn't present on race day.</p>
<h3 id="reconnaissance"><a class="header" href="#reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</a></h3>
<p>I'm a programmer and I had already written some software to <a href="https://github.com/ctm/fantoccini-shiprock#fantoccini-shiprock">scrape
race
results</a>
and to <a href="https://github.com/ctm/runs#ctm-runs">compute</a> the <a href="http://www.mttaylor50k.com/mt.-taylor-doubler.html">Mt. Taylor
Doublers</a> and the
<a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/member-race-series.html">Albuquerque Roadrunners Member Race
Series</a>
scores.</p>
<p>Since 2016, BMDM has had its results and entrants compiled by Its Your
Race, so I used my software to scrape the previous results and the
2023 entrants so I could see who was entered who had previously
finished in less than six hours.</p>
<p>There were only five:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Age</th><th>Name</th><th>Finishing Time</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>37</td><td>DAVID TATHAM</td><td>5:28:30.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON</td><td>5:31:51.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td>Daniel Schuerch</td><td>5:35:42.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>ZACHARY CARNAHAN</td><td>5:38:27.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td>BRIAN HRONIK</td><td>5:47:21.4</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>None of these people had run sub five, and the youngest was 34.  Most
people during the intervening years had probably lost interest,
although the fact that these people had signed up showed they were at
least somewhat interested.  I didn't think it likely (but I was
wrong!) that any of these people would train hard and decrease their
time by more than a half hour, which made me think that if I finished
sub-five, I'd either come in first or would be beat by someone new.
New people usually are surprised by the difficulty of the course.</p>
<h3 id="drugs"><a class="header" href="#drugs">Drugs</a></h3>
<p>I broke down and saw a podiatrist on March 10th, the day before the
King of the Hill Ruck race and only nine days before the Bataan Memorial
Death March.  I explained what was going on and why I believed it was
a morton's neuroma and why we could rule out a stress fracture. He
examined my foot, concurred and gave me a shot of cortisone.</p>
<p>Cortisone is a steroid and I believe its use is a World Anti Doping
Agency (<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en">WADA</a>) violation without a
Therapeutic Use Exemption
(<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/athletes-support-personnel/therapeutic-use-exemptions-tues">TUE</a>). As
far a I know, none of the events I participate in are run using WADA
rules, so this is an area I know very little about.  I did not seek
the cortisone to enhance my ability. It's the only steroid I've ever
used and it certainly wasn't something I turned to lightly.</p>
<p>In addition to the cortisone, I used caffeine (3 double espressos),
200mg ibuprofen, 500mg acetaminophen and a bar of 90% dark chocolate
(contains theobromine) <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/log/2023.txt#L4101-L4153">on race
day</a>.
None of those are (AFAIK) WADA violations, although the ibuprofen and
acetaminophen are barred from
<a href="https://montblanc.utmb.world/races/utmb">UTMB</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre-Race</a></h3>
<p>Almost every day I have a double espresso at 5:15 to &quot;wake me up&quot; (although
I'm typically awake and doing things around 4:45) and to &quot;get me going&quot;. I
chose not to use wake-up caffeine the morning of BMDM, because I didn't want
to need to go to the bathroom when stuck in traffic and because I didn't want
the caffeine wearing off too soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't sleep well. Various noises kept me awake.  So with
less time spent sleeping and with poorer quality of sleep, the lack of caffeine
contributed to me forgetting my handhelds, losing my keys and
chewing up time.</p>
<p>In years past, there were porta-potties on the way out that could be
hit one final time after the gun had started but before crossing the
starting timing mat.  In 2019 the lack of those porta potties
surprised me and interfered with my race.  This year, the lack of
porta potties near the parking area surprised me.  Luckily, I had
brought a lug-a-loo and could use that while Iris slept.  Oops. the
lug-a-loo was in my truck back in Albuquerque. Surprise!</p>
<p>We did make it to the porta potties in time to hit
them—<strong>once</strong>—before heading to our starting positions,
but would once be enough? No.</p>
<h3 id="to-mineral-hill"><a class="header" href="#to-mineral-hill">To Mineral Hill</a></h3>
<p>I rushed to get to the runner's section of the starting line. I wanted
to be settled by the time the opening ceremony began. I succeeded, but
got separated from Iris. We weren't planning on going the same pace, so
that was OK.</p>
<p>They fired the starting (big!) gun. I started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHB06ix3lYgdhd6NgF-zde9tpLh81wsU">my
playlist</a>
and we were off. Before too long we crossed the starting timing mat
and were running. The first six miles are basically downhill and I averaged
about a 9:20 min/mile pace, getting my heart-rate up to around 150 bpm and
holding it there.</p>
<p>I struck up many conversations with fellow runners, typically starting
out by asking if they had run the course before. If they hadn't, I
explained how it would unfold and more often than not I suggested that
they wanted to be careful not to burn out early.</p>
<p>One person mentioned that he knew Ray Pickering, the guy who had
started the Bataan Memorial Death March. He said that Ray was there
and I let him know that I'd love to meet Ray. That didn't happen, but
perhaps some day I'll get that honor.</p>
<p>One person I chatted with recognized me from <a href="https://bataanmarch.com/register/civilian-individual/">my picture on the
Civilian Individual Heavy Division registration
page</a>.</p>
<p>Miles seven and eight are gentle uphills and around mile eight is where
participants doing the honorary march turn to the left.  The rest of us
turn to the right and head up Mineral Hill.</p>
<h3 id="up-mineral-hill"><a class="header" href="#up-mineral-hill">Up Mineral Hill</a></h3>
<p>My goal was to keep my heart rate around 150 bpm going up Mineral Hill.  I
wasn't sure if could keep it that low without having to walk here and there,
but I was much more concerned with not blowing up than I was to artificially
force myself to run the entire way up.</p>
<p>I continued chatting with fellow participants, mostly people who were
traveling my speed. Since I wasn't always running, that allowed me to chat
with some walkers, too.  By this time, I only remember seeing one person
running with a pack, and he too would walk every now and then. He was ahead
of me, but I was gaining.</p>
<p>I asked him if he had done this before and he said he had.  That should have
been a warning, because it meant he knew what he was doing.  I mentioned that
I had probably chatted with him in previous years, but my memory is shot, and
2019 was an eternity in the past.  Of course that was Zachary. While we
were still going up, I passed him.  I (incorrectly!) figured my gap would
only widen, since I can run the downhill pretty quickly. I didn't see him
again until I spotted him at the post event lunch, where I congratulated
him and picked his brain.</p>
<h3 id="down-mineral-hill"><a class="header" href="#down-mineral-hill">Down Mineral Hill</a></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8742917864">my Strava
Track</a>, the course peaks
at mile 13.2. I ran my fifteenth mile in 8:45 and my seventeenth in
10:27, but my sixteenth took me 12:29.  I had to use the porta potty.
Once pass before the start was not enough. Not only did I lose a couple
minutes there, but that's when Zachary passed me.  He knew who I was and
he also recognized my unique backpack.</p>
<p>I didn't know that Zachary had passed me, but I did see a guy with a
small Osprey backpack that looked like it was designed to hold a metal
plate, like a small GoRuck pack. I shouted &quot;Do you have a plate in
there?&quot;  I misinterpreted the smile I got in return and thought that
he had.  My mind wasn't functioning well the entire day. The cascade
of tiredness induced troubles just getting to the starting line left
me even further addled. I was actually surprised that Osprey was
making a plate carrier, but I figured rucking just must be taking off
more than I had realized.  I was delusional.</p>
<h3 id="the-sand-pit"><a class="header" href="#the-sand-pit">The Sand Pit</a></h3>
<p>I don't remember what year they changed the course, but the sand pit
now has some uphill to it. According to Strava, mile twenty-one has 95
feet of gain and mile twenty-two has another 131 feet of gain.  I was
no longer keeping my heart rate up around 150; it was closer to 140
and I was wearing down.  From mile 22.4 to 24.2 is downhill and rather
than using that downhill effectively, I used it to rest.  It took me
11:08 to run my twenty fourth mile even though it was downhill.  I had
let me heart-rate drop down to 135.  I had given up.  I wasn't going
to catch Osprey guy, so I had no chance at first and six days later I
wanted to run fifty miles (but without a pack!).</p>
<h3 id="the-home-stretch"><a class="header" href="#the-home-stretch">The Home Stretch</a></h3>
<p>The twenty-fifth mile was a little up hill and the twenty-sixth a
little down. I ran them in 12:37 ad 12:31.  My heart wasn't in it in
part because my head wasn't in it.  Not only was I not thinking
straight, but I had never looked at my elapsed time and furthermore, I
misremembered my PR as 4:35 or 4:36 and not 4:39.  A PR was in my
grasp, but I didn't even know it.  I spent months training, but not
enough time working on a race-day plan.</p>
<h3 id="second"><a class="header" href="#second">Second</a></h3>
<p>After finishing, I called my sister Marcia.  She's completed the Bataan
Memorial Death March (without a pack) and typically comes out to join us.
This year, she needed to stay back in Albuquerque.  I couldn't get the
tracking app to work on my phone, so I didn't know where I had placed.
There was a results tent, but it had a sign saying that your results
wouldn't be available until about a half hour after you crossed the
finish line.</p>
<p>I figured Marcia could use the web to find out how many people had
finished ahead of me.  My time was roughly 4:40, but Osprey guy
probably finished sub 4:30 and there was no way I had a sub 4:30 in me
this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second (pause) and unless I botched the math, by twenty three seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you shitting me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was quite proud that my sister had thought of this way to yank my
chain<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Nope. Oh well, there's always next year.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I figured she was still upset from when we were young adults
and I told her matter-of-factly that cat's can't see through glass and
she believed me<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>That was payback from when we were both kids.  She
told me she was learning about exponents and I unskillfully lied that I
already knew what they were. She offered that they were the king of
France. &quot;Yeah, I knew that.&quot; I lied again.</p>
