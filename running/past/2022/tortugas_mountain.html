<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I completed fourteen loops: four before sleeping, ten after.  I was in
the open division, not the drinking division, but I did drink a bit.
Several people finished with more loops than I did, but I needed to be
very conservative so that I could return to Albuquerque (a three and
half hour drive) after the awards ceremony in order to be the five
hour pace group leader for the Duke City marathon.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre-Race</a></h2>
<p>The day before the race, I borrowed $100 from my son for gas money.  I
didn’t think that would be enough for all the gas I would consume, but
I still had some cash in my wallet and a tiny bit in the bank which I
could use via my debit card.</p>
<p>On race day, I woke up and went to make my wife a cappuccino only to
realize we were out of espresso beans.  Oops!  We had been using
fairly scruffy beans of late, so I chose to drive down to <a href="https://www.michaelthomascoffee.com/">Michael
Thomas</a> and get some <strong>excellent</strong>
beans. I knew the expenditure <em>might</em> leave me without enough money for
gas on the way home, but after some work on my truck, I didn’t have an
estimate of the miles per gallon I’d get on the trip.  I thought I’d
be fine but knew that if I was wrong I could borrow money from any of
a number of people I knew who would be at the race.</p>
<p>Instead of driving directly to the start/finish site, I drove to
<a href="http://spotteddogbrewery.com/">Spotted Dog Brewery</a> because I had an
empty growler with a gift card good for a fill attached to it.  It was
awarded to me for finishing first in the drinking division last year.
I didn’t fill it last year because it was awarded at the end of the
race and by then I had already drunk fourteen beers during the course
of the race and another celebratory beer or two after.  They had a wee
heavy on tap, so I chose that, but needed to pay about an extra ten
bucks because of inflation and/or the wee heavy being a bit pricier
(after all, at 9.5% ABV it is about double the strength of normal
beer).  I tipped $5, because by then I was reasonably sure I was going
to need to hit someone up for some additional gas money and I didn’t
want my current cash-poor situation turning me into a stingy bastard.</p>
<p>From Spotted Dog, I drove to the <a href="https://bryanberg.net/files/outdoors-hiking-areas-with-maps/mountain-time-2/monte-vista-trail-tortugas-a-mountain/">Monte Vista Hiking Trail Parking
Log</a>.
That’s where the start/finish line is and where I camp.  I got there
about and hour and a half before the race was due to start, which was
an hour before the drinkers were going to have a rule-change meeting.
Although I wasn’t going to participate in the drinking division, I had
had an epiphany and realized that I could still drink a bit at the
beginning without it jeopardizing my health (e.g., allowing me to
catch a cold) or otherwise decreasing my ability to pace the Duke City
Marathon.</p>
<p>That hour and a half was enough time for me to set up my tent and socialize.
Embarrassingly, I did not recognize Rob, the founder of this event.  I know
Rob’s son Justin better than Rob, although it’s been a few years since I’ve
seen Justin and I probably couldn’t pick him out of crowd either.  In addition
to Rob, who lives in Las Cruces, Kathy had driven down from Albuquerque.
Kathy had done the Feral Hog 25k six days prior, so she and I were the only
Feral Hog participants who were also doing the 24 Hour Challenge.  That
makes us Feral Tortugas!</p>
<p>In some sense, however, the two most important people I ran into were
Perky and Prince Charming.  They had ponied up for the two porta
potties.  Yay!  As we chatted, I found out that the winners (male and
female) of the beer division were <em>not</em> going to get a growler this
year.  I didn’t yet know why, but I did volunteer that I had just
picked up a growler of wee heavy and before I had even asked about
borrowing gas money, Perky volunteered to by the growler for me.  I
asked for $20, which was the amount I was going to borrow, but she
handed me $30.  I wasn’t going to fight her over the extra, especially
since Prince Charming could break me in half like a toothpick.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was five-thirty, a half hour before race
start and the beer drinkers gathered to hear the new rules and the big
surprise.  Instead of only the winners of the beer division getting a
gift, everyone who was going to drink a beer at this little meeting
(i.e., before the first lap) got a very nice <em>large</em> beer stein with
the Beer Soaked logo and the epitaph “It’s my own damn fault!”  I
drank a 16 oz. 7.5% ABV <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24659/67709/">Malpais
Stout</a> and
thanked Rob profusely for this participant’s award.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this race I had decided that since I wasn’t
going to compete, I’d make an already social event even more social by
running each loop with a different person and chatting with (at?)
them.  However, I never articulated this plan, which was good, because
I changed my mind when I remembered that I often have a Zoom meeting
with a bunch of friends on Friday, Saturday and occasionally Wednesday
evenings at 6pm, which was the starting time for Tortugas Mountain.
They knew I was a crazy person who liked to run in circles, now I got
a chance to show them.</p>
<h2 id="loops-before-bed"><a class="header" href="#loops-before-bed">Loops Before Bed</a></h2>
<p>I finished <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7964427510">four loops</a>
before heading into my tent to sleep.</p>
<p>So, I used my phone to join the Zoom meeting, explained to the people
on the meeting what I was doing, then switched to the forward facing
camera and stayed on the meeting until the final person dropped off
about four hours later.</p>
<p>Before my second loop I had a 12 oz. 7% ABV <a href="https://santafebrewing.com/beer/social-hour/">Social
Hour</a> and before my
third loop I had a 12 oz. 7% ABV <a href="https://tumblerootbreweryanddistillery.com/beer/sunset-hazy-ipa/">Sunset Hazy
IPA</a>.
On my fourth lap I fell from grace and did not drink a beer.  This was
according to plan.  I had already had the equivalent of five beers due
to the first one being a pint rather than twelve ounces and all of
them being stronger than 5% ABV.  When competing in the drinking
division, you must drink a beer each loop (in previous years it was
<em>before</em> each loop, i.e. in the start/finish area, but this year they
relaxed the rules and allow you to drink the beer as you
run/hike/walk/stumble).  As such, when competing in the drinking
division, it makes sense to have the weakest beer allowed (5% ABV) and
the smallest amount (12 oz.) because drinking stronger beer adds up
(just ask Jason, who was drinking 7% ABV beers at the beginning last
year!).  However, since I was in the open division, stacking a little
more alcohol early was just that much more social lubricant for my
zoom call.</p>
<p>My plan had been to finish five or six laps before going to bed, but I
hadn’t really thought things through and I hadn’t even considered the
Zoom call, which slowed me down a bit.  So when I saw that it was about
eleven thirty at the end of my fourth lap, I decided it was a good time
to stop and get some sleep.</p>
<p>It took me a little while to sleep and I woke up a few times, both to
use my pee bottle and to hear some fun friendly noise as various
runners finished their laps.  That was great, it meant that even my
sleeping was semi-social.</p>
<p>At 5:15 my alarm went off like it usually does and I had the double espresso
I had made at home and brought with me.  I probably have a double espresso
at 5:15 Mountain time 360 days a year.  Every once in a while I shift when
I have it, but only in extenuating circumstances.  I typically wake up
well before 5:15 but wait until 5:15 (on the second!) to drink the espresso
because I use it to synchronize my sleep so that I don’t get up earlier and
earlier or later and later and to also tell my GI system to do its thing.</p>
<p>It was still dark out, so I put my Kogolla light bar and Petzl headlamp
back on (those are what I was using the night before) putzed around a bit
hoping for the caffeine to allow me to take a dump, got impatient and
finally started my next loops at 5:36am.</p>
<h2 id="loops-after-bed"><a class="header" href="#loops-after-bed">Loops After Bed</a></h2>
<p>I completed <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7969011612">ten loops</a>
after sleeping.</p>
<p>Although I had much less sleep and a lower quality of sleep than normal,
I felt great.  My lighting was excellent and it was a bit cooler. I ran
my first few post-bedtime laps in a little under an hour each, and that
includes the time I was taking to eat like a piggy at the start/finish
aid station as well as at the aid station that is roughly at the half-way
point.</p>
<p>I had really enjoyed my Zoom the night before, so I did something
similar at 11am.  I have a different group of people who have a
recurring 11am daily zoom.  I’ve known some of these people for close
to thirty years but I only recently found out that they had this Zoom
call every day (perhaps I knew that at one point and forgot, but I’m
not on Facebook and I don’t recall reading about it on our mailing
list).  There were only two others on the call, but it was fun to do a
show-and-tell and answer questions for about a half hour.</p>
<p>Like many a looped-course ultra, this race was run “washing-machine”
style, meaning runners switch directions for each loop.  The first and
all odd loops were run clockwise (as viewed from above), the second
and all even loops counter-clockwise.  That allows competitors to see
their competition and allows social participants to see the entire
field, at least briefly, several times.  However, it did conspire
against allowing me to spend time with Lukas, the winner.  We were
chatting a little bit at the start/finish aid station, and we
continued our conversation as we jogged together back to the main
course, but, alas, he turned right and I turned left. For the next
several loops, I’d see Lukas at the start/finish aid station, it was
almost like clockwork.  The difference though is that before we synced
up he had already run <em>seven</em> more laps than I had! He also chose to
run a final lap after I had called it a day, so he got twenty-two laps
in all told, while I finished a mere fourteen.</p>
<p>Around 2pm I was finishing my twelfth lap and I had already worked out
the numbers.  If I sped up a little I could get three more laps in
before the 6pm finish time, but that would be taxing, might increase
my chance of injury and would leave me little time to tear down my
tent and put things away before the awards ceremony.  As such, I
decided that I would do fourteen laps this year, just like last year,
but since it was in the open division, I wouldn’t even podium.  Last
year my fourteen laps (and fourteen “beers” (they were mostly hard
seltzers which I might explain sometime, but not now)) was not just
first place in the drinking division but a new course record.</p>
<p>Once I realized I was only going to do two more laps, I decided to see
if I could mooch a beer for each of my two final laps.  There would be
four hours between the first of the two beers and the end of the race
and about two and a half before the second beer and the end of the
race and even after the end of the race was the awards ceremony, so I
would still be able to drive safely, legally and comfortably.  I came
into the aid station and asked if anyone could give me a beer and the
few people who were there were all out of beer!  Someone, however,
(Marco?), let me know that earlier Perky and Prince Charming had
offered him a beer which he had declined, so he retroactively accepted
that beer and gave it to me (i.e., we pilfered a Miller High Life from
their cooler).  I know P&amp;PC well enough to know that they wouldn’t
mind and that I probably was not draining them dry.</p>
<p>Guess whom I saw when finishing my thirteenth lap!?  Sure enough P&amp;PC
were at their tailgate, parked next to my truck, and I got to confess
my sin.  They were amused and volunteered to give me another beer.  I
could have another Miller High Life or—what the heck&amp;mash;we
could open the growler.  They even had a nice <em>small</em> plastic cup I
could pour the growler into.  I was sold.  I did have to be careful
to limit myself, because this was indeed stronger brew, but it was
only 3:30pm and I wouldn’t be driving until 6:15 or 6:30.</p>
<p>I had some of the wee heavy and was futzing with my stuff as P&amp;PC
departed.  Like I, they were going to head out on a counter-clockwise
loop.  I knew I would catch up with them and this time, I’d actually
hang out and chat on the loop.  So, a little while later I topped off
my beer and headed up.  I wanted to catch up, but I also didn’t want
to spill my beer.  I didn’t execute perfectly and there was a little
sloshing over the side, but shortly I was within chatting distance.</p>
<p>Perky walks quickly!  Here walking pace is slower than mine, so she
would get ahead of Prince Charming and myself and eventually PC would
remind me to run a bit to catch up so that I wouldn’t have to shout so
much.  We had good time catching up and discussing our plans for 2023.</p>
<h2 id="post-race"><a class="header" href="#post-race">Post-Race</a></h2>
<p>At 5:09 I was done with my laps and done drinking until after noon the
following day.  I pulled out my cooler and spent about a half hour
packing my sleeping mat, eating recovery food fortified (with chia
seeds, hemp seeds, soy milk and Udo’s Oil)) oatmeal, nasty green
drink, rice milk and some spaghetti and most importantly listening to
everyone’s stories.  I then hastily packed my tent, gathered the rest
of my gear and shoved everything in my truck so that I could be back
for the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>The two times I’ve done this previously, I’ve left my tent set up and
gone back to it after the ceremony.  This year, with the start of the
Duke City Marathon less than thirteen hours away, I said thanks,
hopped in my truck, drove to a gas station, bought fifty dollars of
fuel, saw that my tank was almost full, crossed my fingers and got on
the road.  Oh, while the gas was pumping, I had the choice: eat more
spaghetti or clean the bug blots off my windshield.  The splats were a
bit of a nuisance, but I was hungry, so I left them there.</p>
<p>My drive back was mostly uneventful.  I was not tired.  I was not wired.
I wasn’t overly anxious, but I did continue looking at the gas gauge with
regularity.  I had one obnoxious driver to deal with, but luckily that
vehicle pulled off in Truth or Consequences (that’s the name of a town).</p>
<p>Everything was basically going fine until I ran into a little rain.
My truck has fairly dim headlights (although they’re a little bit
brighter than they had been a few days go before I replaced a bulb)
and my night vision isn’t great.  My windshield wipers are pretty
poor, but it wasn’t supposed to rain until the next day, or at least
that’s what I thought.  Had I known it would rain, I wouldn’t have
eaten that spaghetti.  Light rain, bug bits, and poor windshield
wipers are a bad combination, especially at night.  Luckily, there
were some gaps in the slime that I could see through until the rain
came down harder and everything got cleaned up.</p>
<p>I got home around 9:30, started charging my electrical stuff, took a
shower, put away a few things, set my alarm for 4:30am and got to bed
around 11pm.  Tomorrow would be fun (and I’m not being sarcastic).</p>
<p>Whee!</p>
<h2 id="food"><a class="header" href="#food">“Food”</a></h2>
<p>I brought some food from Albuquerque and think I might have had enough
calories to squeak by, but there was yummy junk food at the aid stations
so I ate a ton of that during the race.</p>
<p>Sophie had made a bunch of potato slices roasted in spiced oil.  I had a few
in Albuquerque for lunch, then stuffed a lot more in a baggie for the
drive down.  Sure enough, I ate them all.</p>
<p>Before the race I ate a bag of lentils (2/3rds cup when they were
dry).  I had made an entire package of spaghetti (approximately 2,000
calories), but only ate a little of that during the race.  Most came
back to Albuquerque with me and I ate it on the Monday and Tuesday
after the race.</p>
<p>Sophie had made some homemade hummus and I took half of it with me in a
baggie.  With the baggie sitting on top of the ice in the cooler, the hummus
took on a Play-Doh consistency, which was great, because I could tear off a
piece and eat it without utensils.  I also brought a baggie of steamed
broccoli and cauliflower that I ate mid-day Saturday.</p>
<p>I ate a huge amount of aid station “orange slice” candies and pretzels
on both days.  Thanks!</p>
<p>On Saturday, I additionally snacked on salt &amp; vinegar potato chips,
some vegan cookies that were kind of like cream colored Oreos and some
vegan Dijon mustard crisps.  I had a Mountain Dew after each of my first
two Saturday laps.</p>
<p>At the remote aid station, after I had eaten all the orange slice candies,
I had a big handful of M&amp;Ms and eight tiny Twix bites.  Neither of those
are vegan; they both have milk in them.  I believe those were the only two
non-vegan things I consumed.</p>
<h2 id="minor-setbacks"><a class="header" href="#minor-setbacks">Minor Setbacks</a></h2>
<h3 id="chafing"><a class="header" href="#chafing">Chafing</a></h3>
<p>I did not bring Body Glide and my running shorts irritated me a little
bit.  I also was wearing an ultra-vest without a shirt when I was using
my Kogolla light bar because I wanted something to hold the battery
and (when not Zooming) my iPod touch.  However, at one point I also
added tube filled with water and that extra pressure was enough to
chafe my right nipple.  Eventually I realized what was going on and
moved the water to the other side and everything was fine.</p>
<h3 id="sunburn"><a class="header" href="#sunburn">Sunburn</a></h3>
<p>I didn’t wear any sunscreen, so I got a minor sunburn.  I definitely didn’t
feel it at the time, so I don’t think it slowed me down appreciably.  I felt
it slightly after getting home. Over the next couple of days the red turned
to tan, so I’m happy.</p>
<h3 id="falling"><a class="header" href="#falling">Falling</a></h3>
<p>I fell and hit the ground a few times.  The first two or three times were,
IIRC, Saturday, i.e., after I had slept, before I was drinking beer again.
I tore some skin here and there but none were bad enough to introduce a
limp or cause trouble post race.</p>
<h3 id="heat"><a class="header" href="#heat">Heat</a></h3>
<p>I had meant to bring my ice hat and use it, both because I think it speeds
me up, but also to get a little practice with it before Javelina Jundred.
I even had it in the file that I created that had the
list of things to bring, but I forgot to look at that file.</p>
<h2 id="music-driven-legs"><a class="header" href="#music-driven-legs">Music Driven Legs</a></h2>
<p>I easily get the runner’s high.  While I have it, music often hits me
emotionally.  I feel like I’m a bull being led by a nose-ring and when
the music is upbeat or perhaps just emotionally satisfying, I
sometimes use it to drive my legs.  One song that touched me while I
was out there was City of New Orleans.  City of New Orleans was
written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Goodman">Steve
Goodman</a> but made famous
by Arlo Guthrie.  Neither of those two were singing it, but since it
came off my iPod library, I might eventually figure out whose version
it was.</p>
<p>Listening to anything Steve Goodman had to do with always brings out a mix
of emotions in me.  The guy died of cancer when he was 36 but penned and
performed many a classic.  City of New Orleans isn’t particularly fast,
and I find it melancholy, but it was definitely driving my legs hard as I
finished up one of my daylight even laps.  I can’t remember the other
songs that wound me up, although one of them was by Jesus Jones.</p>
<h2 id="historical"><a class="header" href="#historical">Historical</a></h2>
<p>The Tortuga Mountain 24 Hour Challenge started out as a drinking event, where
all participants were required to drink a beer before each 4 mile loop around
Tortugas Mountain (also known as “A” Mountain due to the capital ‘A’ in white
rock on the hill that is visible for miles).  The beer needed to be 12 ounces
or more and 5% ABV or more.</p>
<p>As the event became popular, some people chose to do it without all
the beer, so separate divisions were created.  These divisions are
recognized at the event itself, but are not made in the UltraSignup
results. So, you can either take my word or ask a race director, but
in 2021, I set a new course record of 14 beers and <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=83711#id220546">56
miles</a>.</p>
