<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I had run the <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm">Big Cottonwood Marathon</a>
twice prior: <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1579538">2019</a>
and <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1792746">2021</a>.  Both
times, I raced it so I could (and did!) qualify for the Boston
Marathon. It is a very downhill course, although the rollers starting
around mile 19 have slowed me down all three years.</p>
<p>This year, however, my truck died the day before and that
complicated my race.  Luckily, I’ll be sixty years old by Boston
2023, so I only needed to run a 3:50 to qualify and I ran
<a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=7660499">3:25:32</a>.</p>
<p>This report is for my own benefit.  Although I remember the details
clearly as I write this, it won’t be too long before I forget many of
the details.  My plan is to switch from running the Big Cottonwood
Marathon as a Boston Qualifier to running the Tucson marathon.  My
MSCS advisor has moved to Tucson and running that race would be a good
excuse to visit him.  Additionally, Aravaipa puts on a good event.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-albuquerque-to-moab"><a class="header" href="#thursday-albuquerque-to-moab">Thursday: Albuquerque to Moab</a></h2>
<p>I left Albuquerque around the time I thought I’d need to leave in
order to arrive at <a href="https://moabkitchen.com/">Moab Kitchen</a> around
4pm, i.e., just as they were opening.  I love Moab Kitchen and I also
found a great campsite just north of there last year that I was looking
forward to returning to.</p>
<p>I did indeed get there shortly after four. I ate some food, made a
business call, caught up on my email and was about to drive to the
<a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#geminibridges">Gemini Bridges Road
campground</a>
when I remembered that the last time I had tried to use four-wheel
drive I had trouble shifting it in and out. So, instead of waiting
until I absolutely had to have 4WD, I decided to check it in the Moab
Kitchen parking lot. Uh oh. Not only was it exceedingly hard for me to
get it into 4-Low, I basically couldn’t get it, unassisted, back into
2WD.</p>
<p>After texting some friends for advice, I tried rocking the truck back
and forth, and finally I got it into 2WD.  Dodged a bullet!  Gemini
Bridges was out, so I chose to go to <a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#klondikebluffs">Klondike Bluffs
Road</a>
instead. My truck sounded a little funny as I was driving, but I was
harried and there may have been grooves in the asphalt.  I couldn’t
figure out if I was imagining things.</p>
<p>I set up my tent, read a bit of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29359067-presto-how-i-made-over-100-pounds-disappear-and-other-magical-tales">Presto!</a>,
then went to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork"><a class="header" href="#friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork">Friday morning: Moab to Spanish Fork</a></h2>
<p>I woke up at my normal time and kicked myself for not having joined
AAA.  My buddy Jason’s truck’s radiator catastrophically failed a
couple weeks prior. He had to pay a huge bill to get his truck towed.
At the time, I had mentioned that I keep meaning to sign up for AAA
(my truck is a 1998 with more than 200,000 miles on it), but I always
forget. So, although it would have been better to have signed up well
before heading out from Albuquerque, I used my phone as a hot-spot and
joined AAA.</p>
<p>The noise I thought I had heard while driving the previous night had
disappeared, or perhaps it had never been there or maybe even I had
gotten accustomed to it. Regardless, other than running way too low on
gas and having to pay around $6/gallon to get a few gallons at a
remote gas station, the drive went well until I my truck failed to
drive when the stoplight I was at turned green.</p>
<p>I was in the left-most of three non-turning lanes on highway six in
Spanish Fork.  I put my hazards on, then tried putting the truck in
neutral and pushing it out of the way.  It moved a little before it
stopped and couldn’t be pushed.  Not by me solo and not when three
large men volunteered to help.  The transmission was fried and nothing
I did helped.</p>
<p>I tried to arrange a tow through AAA but their system didn’t work well,
so it literally took hours while I interacted with them.  Eventually
my truck was towed to Tunex in nearby Springville.  The Tunex people
were nice and understanding, but not only did they need to diagnose
the problem, they also had to find a replacement transfer case and
drive-train so they could get me a quote.  It was not going to be
cheap, nor would it be done soon.</p>
<h2 id="friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel"><a class="header" href="#friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel">Friday afternoon: Spanish Fork to packet pickup and the hotel</a></h2>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a car in Springville that I could rent for
a day at <a href="https://turo.com/">Turo</a>.  Sometime around 5pm, I was able
to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7792735587">jog over to the rental
car</a>, drive back to
Tunex, grab a bunch of stuff from my truck (including my food; I had
chosen to drive north in a fasted state, because I figured I’d eat
in the packet pickup parking lot around noon), then drive to packet
pickup which was going to close at 7pm.</p>
<p>There was at least one accident that caused the freeway to crawl to a
halt.  I think there were actually two.  It was a bit nerve-racking
both because I needed to get to packet pickup by 7, but I certainly
didn’t want to get into a fender bender.</p>
<p>I made it to packet pickup around 6pm and then got checked in to the
Residence Inn around 7pm.  I had not yet eaten that day.  I had
previously planned on what I would eat and when, but that all got
thrown out the door when my truck died. I wound up eating about <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/log/2022.txt#L10604-L10608">3,000
calories of
food</a>
(including the highish-fiber oatmeal that was supposed to be my
post-race recovery food) in an hour or so and going to bed.</p>
<h2 id="race-day-pre-race"><a class="header" href="#race-day-pre-race">Race Day, pre-race</a></h2>
<p>My alarm woke me up at 3:15 and I drank a double espresso.  I think I had
fallen asleep around 9:30, so almost six hours.  Had the previous day not
been so hectic, <em>my guess</em> is I’d have fallen asleep about an hour earlier
(and had my final calories several hours before that).</p>
<p>I had a little food at the hotel before the hotel buses drove us to the
start.  I immediately headed to the porta-potties and kept walking all
the way to the end of them and the last one was unused. Yay.</p>
<p>I put on my sweatpants and a sweatshirt and wrapped myself in the space
blanket from packet pickup.  I killed time by reading a book written by
the daughter of a Bataan Death March survivor.  Around 6:15 (I think),
I drank a double espresso. Sometime around then I also ate some basmati
rice and took two 200mg ibuprofen tablets.</p>
<p>Initially I had planned on only taking 200mg pre-race and 200mg at the
halfway point, but I had forgotten to do laundry before getting ready
to leave Albuquerque, so I didn’t have a lot of clean socks.  I did,
however, have a clean pair of very thin socks.  I also didn’t have any
low-mileage road shoes, so I chose the Torin pair with around 850
miles on them (as opposed to my other pair with over 1,400) and
decided the combination of ancient shoes and thin socks merited
additional analgesics.</p>
<h3 id="poor-porta-potty-position"><a class="header" href="#poor-porta-potty-position">Poor Porta-Potty Position</a></h3>
<p>The very trick that allowed me to get an open porta-potty fresh off
the bus worked against me this time.  Thinking I had plenty of time, I
got in the closest porta-potty line to where I had been sitting.  That
was the left-most line. When there is a row of N porta-potties and N
is large enough (e.g., eight or more), people at the head of any given
line then typically advance to the first of up to three porta-potties
ahead of them, specifically the one directly in front of them and one
to either side.</p>
<p>The upside of one person having the choice of three porta-potties is
that it lessens the chance of a line being completely held up by
someone taking a longer than usual time in a potty.  It does, however,
require each person at the head of the line paying attention to make
sure that each line is still moving more-or-less fairly. The downside
is that a line can stall if the person at the head of that line
doesn’t understand this de facto protocol, is distracted or simply
doesn’t want to take any stall except the one directly in front.</p>
<p>All else equal, the lines at either end of a row of porta-potties will
move at two-thirds the speed of the interior lines, because the person
at the head of the line will only have two porta-potties to choose
from, while the person at the head of an interior line has three.  I
knew this, but still chose to stand in the left-most line, figuring
that since I had plenty of time, two-thirds speed would get me in and
out with room to spare.  I was wrong.</p>
<p>The line I was in stalled.  I think the person at the head of the line
not only wasn’t considering the diagonal stall as a possible choice, but
he also wasn’t noticing that people from the adjacent line were taking
the stall in front of him repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="drawstring-disaster"><a class="header" href="#drawstring-disaster">Drawstring Disaster</a></h3>
<p>It had been cool enough that I had chosen to not take off my pre-run
outer layer, so I still had my pre-race bag with me, and the drop off
for that was back up the hill.  I decided it was more important to
pack my bag and get it dropped off and get back to the start line than
attempt to take another poop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I went to tie up my bag, the string broke.  I asked
the person shoveling bags into the truck if he had a spare bag, but he
didn’t and directed me further up the hill.  I went all the way up and
nope, nobody up there had spare bags either, but there were several people
who also had broken strings.</p>
<p>I extracted the two pieces of string from the drawstring portion of the bag,
tied them together and then asked a woman for assistance.  She offered to
tie my bag while I held it, but I politely asked her to hold the bag while
I tied it so that if it came undone and I lost anything (and my phone and
wallet were in the bag!), I’d only have myself to blame.</p>
<p>I then descended to the bag-drop truck and handed them my bag and found my
place in line. With little fanfare, the race started at 6:45.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-itself"><a class="header" href="#the-race-itself">The Race itself</a></h2>
<p>Waiting in line for the race to start I was a little concerned by the
possibility of my bag either opening and disgorging some of its
contents or losing the tie that had my bib number.</p>
<p>If the bag was intact, but without a bib number, would I be able to
find it? Probably; they’d presumably set it aside and I could identify
it, or perhaps they’d open it and find my wallet. Similarly, if my
wallet or phone slipped out, I’d probably be able to reclaim them,
too.</p>
<p>Before the race started I felt like I probably <em>could</em> poop if given
the chance, but I didn’t feel like I <em>needed</em> to.</p>
<p>Once I crossed the starting line, all my anxiety disappeared.  The
initial downhill grade is steep enough that it takes me a little
effort and concentration to adjust my cadence and stride so I’m
getting the “free downhill”, not fighting it, but also not running out
of control.</p>
<p>Before the race had begun, I was chatting with another runner and he
mentioned that the aid stations would have gels.  With that in mind, I
lightened my expandable waistband by removing five of the seven gels I
had, figuring I’d just take them from the aid station. I think that
was the right thing to do, but it did mean that my gel consumption was
less predictable, because not all aid stations. I would have known
that had I researched it pre-race, since it was <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/info#aid">well
documented</a> on the Big
Cottonwood Marathon website.</p>
<h3 id="bam"><a class="header" href="#bam">Bam!</a></h3>
<p>About nineteen miles in, I knew I had to take a porta-potty break to
poop. As I feared, eating as much as I did the prior evening caught up
with me. I was in and out fairly quickly, but a bit distracted as I
tried to tie my running short drawstring as I ran.  I was still
running a little to the right (i.e., where the porta-potties had been)
of the road when I tripped and hit fairly hard.</p>
<p>My left knee took the brunt of the impact, but I also managed to
scrape my right knee and bloody my right palm. I was able to get back
up almost immediately and resume running.  I had taken an additional
400mg of ibuprofen at mile 13 and by now it was kicking in, so I
didn’t have that much discomfort and didn’t limp, per-se, but my gait
was slightly affected.</p>
<h2 id="excuses-excuses"><a class="header" href="#excuses-excuses">Excuses, excuses</a></h2>
<p>This year I was three minutes and sixteen seconds slower than last
year, but my average heart rate was ten beats per minute slower.  I
think that had I been able to eat on the day before like I had planned
and gotten to sleep when I planned, I wouldn’t have needed the
porta-potty. I also think that I slowed a little before I resigned
myself to making that stop and I suspect that had I not made the
porta-potty stop I wouldn’t have fallen.</p>
<p>So, did my truck’s death the day before prevent me from PR’ing? Maybe.
On the other hand, it took me 1:29:50 to get to mile 12 this year and
only 1:28:08 to get there the year before.  Mile 12 was long before I
took the porta-potty break, so presumably I wasn’t slowed as much by
GI distress and definitely wasn’t slowed by the fall (that hadn’t yet
occurred) in my first 12 miles.  On the other hand, last year my heart-rate
was around 150bpm at mile 12, but only around 135bpn at mile 12.  My
average HR was still around 150bpm on my 24th mile last year, but had only
crept up to 140bpm by during my 24th mile this year. I believe my HR data
suggests I was being held back a bit at the end, but I’ll never know.</p>
<p>FWIW, had I finished fifteen seconds earlier, I’d have been 3rd in my age
group. I’d need to take off an <em>additional</em> five minutes and seventeen
seconds to have taken 2nd AG and another six seconds after that to have
been first in my age group this year. No truck problems probably would
have given me 3rd AG. I think 2nd or 1st AG would have been a coin-flip.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nobody my age or older finished before I did, which
is what I call—tongue in cheek—<a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/video/view/16381">beating
the old people</a>.  Whee!</p>
<h2 id="aftermath"><a class="header" href="#aftermath">Aftermath</a></h2>
<p>The injury to my left knee was minor, but sufficiently uncomfortable
that I used ibuprofen for several days after the fall.  I fell on
September 10th and the last time I used ibuprofen for my knee was
midnight between the 16th and 17th.  The scab on my knee finally came
off on October 13th, almost five weeks after the fall.  Normally my
scabs go away in two weeks.</p>
<p>Luckily, it was an injury to the outside of my knee and not anything
internal to my knee itself.  Although I didn’t do a big hike a week
after the Big Cottonwood Marathon due to being stuck in Utah, I did do
the AA50k 13 days after and the Tour of the Rio Grande 15 days after.</p>
<p>I have added this aftermath section so that if I ever review this
report, it’ll remind me to not fall on asphalt, especially when
accelerating in a road marathon.  It could have been <em>much</em> worse.</p>
