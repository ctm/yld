<p><a href="http://www.mttaylor50k.com/home.html">The Mt. Taylor 50k</a> is an
awesome race. No matter how much time I put into this race report,
I simply will not be able to do it justice.
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Ken&amp;lname=Gordon">Ken</a>,
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Margaret&amp;lname=Gordon">Margaret</a>
and
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Kurt&amp;lname=Coonrod">Kurt</a>
succinctly summarize it as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mttaylor50/">A race put on by runners, for runners.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One year they
had <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Jim&amp;lname=Walmsley">Jim
Wamsley</a>
and <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Betsy&amp;lname=Kalmeyer">Betsy
Kalmayer</a>
running sweep and rather than boast about them, their presence wasn’t
even mentioned.  Oh, and Betsy was ran sweep this year, too.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-the-mt-taylor-50k"><a class="header" href="#history-of-the-mt-taylor-50k">History of the Mt. Taylor 50k</a></h2>
<p>In 1983, Mark Lautman and Klaus Weber came up with the idea of the
Mt. Taylor Winter Quadrathlon and by 1984 it was a reality. It’s been
drawing athletes to Grants ever since.</p>
<p>Kurt, one of the original co-founders of the Albuquerque Road Runners,
Ken and Margaret liked the area and wanted to introduce it to
Albuquerque’s trail runners.  They came up with an awesome course and
the inaugural running even included Klaus.  The winner was Shaun Martin,
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0Wl3K-kac">Racing the Rez</a> and <a href="https://3100film.com/">3100: Run and Become</a>).</p>
<p>Shaun was also the guest speaker at that inaugural run.  He mentioned
“Greeting the Sunrise”: running toward the east early in the
morning. The Race Directors were already aware of that practice and
deliberately chose the starting time to be just before daybreak so the
participants could all be running toward the east as the sun rises.</p>
<h2 id="tenth-quasi-eleventh-running"><a class="header" href="#tenth-quasi-eleventh-running">Tenth (quasi eleventh) Running</a></h2>
<p>This was the tenth edition. Other than 2020, it’s been an annual
event. There was no formal Mt. Taylor 50k in 2020 due to covid, but
the first dozen or so miles of the course were marked with flour so
that people who wanted to could come out and run the course on their
own if they so chose.</p>
<p>Six lucky runners, myself included, have been able to finish all ten.</p>
<h2 id="my-race"><a class="header" href="#my-race">My Race</a></h2>
<p>My goal was to experience beauty, have fun, <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=91682#id220546">finish</a> and watch others
finish. I was successful.</p>
<p>This write-up is primarily to remind me of what I did and what worked
and what failed.  It does not go into the beauty of the course or even
discuss any of the terrain or features.  There are excellent race
reports for this race out there (and maybe I’ll take the time to dig
up some links after I finish my memory dump).</p>
<h3 id="camping"><a class="header" href="#camping">Camping</a></h3>
<p>There are plenty of good places to camp before the race. Jeff, my
brother-in-law, and I have been camping in the same place for the last
few years.  Were it not for the <a href="https://balloonfiesta.com/">Albuquerque International Balloon
Fiesta</a>, I’d have camped at least two
nights and probably three. However, I’ve been crewing for the same
balloon pilot for far longer than I’ve been a runner, so Friday morning
I helped with the balloon before driving over to Grants. Saturday,
after helping tear-down, I drove home so I could get up Sunday and
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7899686153">run down to the field</a>.</p>
<p>I got to Grants before packet-pickup opened, so I asked if there were
any chores I could do. Kim suggested I help unpack the shirts. I did
so, but very inefficiently. I wasn’t even a quarter of the way done
with the men’s shirts by the time Kim was done with the women’s and
she started much later than I did.</p>
<p>It was good to see Lynette and Kathy who were doing serious
volunteering.  I hung around a little longer and saw some of the early
packet picker-uppers, then drove to my campsite, set my tent up and
walked up to the start/finish area to see if the permanent toilet had
been decorated yet (it hadn’t). I meandered through another set of
campsites on my way back down to my tent.</p>
<p>Jeff had arrived. After he set up his tent, he shared two very nice
beers with me and let me help myself to the homemade hummus my sister
Marcia had made.  I kept going back for more, each time using a single
small slice of pita to scoop up a huge glob of hummus.</p>
<p>We were bedazzled by some lights strung on the other side of the dirt
road.  Upon investigation, it was Elisha and his support group.  He
was going to accompany his wife in the race the following day.  I met
Elisha through Spencer and would see Spencer the following day since
he was doing quite a bit of volunteering.</p>
<h3 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre-race</a></h3>
<p>I slept reasonably well in my tent.  My sleeping pad had a seam come
loose which create an awkward bump, but that only woke me up a few
times.  I also woke up a few times to empty my bladder. Sometime
between 4am and 5am I got up and used the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/207963/reliance-luggable-loo-portable-toilet-with-rope-handle">Luggable
Loo</a>
I had brought.</p>
<p>At 4:30 I had a single serving of my fortified (with hemp, chia, Udo’s
oil and soy milk) oatmeal. At 5:15 I had my “wake-up” double espresso
and at 5:30 I had a large cup of cold coffee I had brought from
Michael Thomas.</p>
<p>I made my way to the start line wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt.  I
got a chance to chat briefly with a ton of people.  Around 6:30 I took
off my sweats.  I was wearing a headlamp, sunglasses on my head, some
running shorts, my GPS watch, socks, shoes and custom orthotics.  I
did not wear a shirt, vest or carry a water bottle, but I did have a
collapsible cup and some gels in the zippered compartment in my
shorts.</p>
<h3 id="first-loop"><a class="header" href="#first-loop">First Loop</a></h3>
<p>I remembered to drop my headlamp when I got to the collection bin.  I had
labeled it with my bib number back in Albuquerque. Yay! I’ve forgotten to
drop it off previously and also remembered to drop it off but forgotten to
label it previously.</p>
<p>Somewhere there was a chance for me to get water, and I did so using
my collapsible cup. Before getting to Spud Patch I ate four (100
calorie) gels.</p>
<h4 id="spud-patch"><a class="header" href="#spud-patch">Spud Patch</a></h4>
<p>There was frost on the ground at spud patch. I was still plenty warm
without my shirt.  I believe I ate two Oreos, an oatmeal cookie (which
may not have been vegan) and some pretzels and drank a cupful of
Tailwind and two cupfuls of water.</p>
<p>I almost made it back to Rock Tank without tripping. I was so close
that I had already patted myself on the back for doing so when … I
caught my foot and hit the ground. Luckily, it was my right knee,
because my left knee was still tender (and still scabbed over) from my
fall at the Big Cotton Marathon.</p>
<h4 id="rock-tank"><a class="header" href="#rock-tank">Rock Tank</a></h4>
<p>I had planned on wearing my ultra vest at Rock Tank, but I also had two
handhelds in my drop bag “just in case”.  I chose to just take one handheld
with me.</p>
<p>I ate a handful of gummy candies, and maybe a banana.  I took a
handful of pretzels with me.  This may have been the fastest I’ve
gotten out of Rock Tank and it would have been ever so slightly faster
if my handheld had been pre-filled with water.</p>
<h3 id="second-loop"><a class="header" href="#second-loop">Second Loop</a></h3>
<p>I did fall enough for my hand to hit the ground once or twice after
Rock Tank and before Gooseberry, but neither knee hit.</p>
<p>At one point a silver haired man started running next to me and I
guessed it was
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Senovio&amp;lname=Torres">Senovio</a>.
He’s nine years older than me but plenty faster. I jokingly like to
“beat the old people”, meaning finish faster than anyone my age or
older, but that doesn’t happen when Senovio is entered.</p>
<p>I chatted with Senovio a bit and brought up his daughter, because I
knew he was proud that she finally beat him.  Eventually, <em>everyone</em>
slows down as they age, so a parent who has a running child will
eventually be overtaken. It’s a day I look forward to. Unfortunately,
his daughter had some surgery that prevented her from being at
Mt. Taylor.</p>
<p>Senovio was already running faster than I wanted to run, so after paying my
respects, I slowed down and he ran out of earshot.</p>
<h4 id="gooseberry"><a class="header" href="#gooseberry">Gooseberry</a></h4>
<p>When I got to the Gooseberry aid station, Senovio was just about to
leave.  At that point I knew I was running too quickly and I also
didn’t want my competitive nature kicking in, because Senovio would be
me regardless and I’d simply beat myself up trying to keep up with
him, so I had a <a href="https://santafebrewing.com/beer/oktoberfest/">beer</a>
and a <a href="https://www.fireballwhisky.com/">shot</a> instead.  Sure enough,
that tamped my competitive spirit.</p>
<p>During the ascent to the peak, I looked at my heart-rate and saw that
it was around 120.  In general, 130 or below I label as “leisurely”,
because I can run at that heart rate for hours and hours and not get
beaten up too badly.  As such, I felt a little bad that I wasn’t
moving quickly enough to be at 130, but I had a pretty good buzz and
figured I had run my heart a bit faster on the first loop, so I
continued my upward plod.</p>
<p>On my descent from the peak I slipped on a tuft of grass and slid
downhill a little bit.  I don’t think it was from the drinking, seeing
how I had fallen and hit the ground a couple times earlier when I was
sober.</p>
<h4 id="water-canyon"><a class="header" href="#water-canyon">Water Canyon</a></h4>
<p>I got into the Water Canyon aid station and asked how far Barry was in
front of me.  “What’s his number?” “I don’t know” “We can’t look him
up without his number” “OK”.  Of the six people who had run the previous
nine Mt. Taylor 50ks, Barry is the fastest. I was curious as to whether
he was an hour ahead of me or just a few minutes.</p>
<p>I chose not to have any more alcohol, because I was still buzzed.  I
saw some small tubs of guacamole and ate two before I saw that there
was half an avocado available, so I ate that too, grabbed a handful of
peanut butter pretzels and headed down.</p>
<h4 id="water-canyon-again"><a class="header" href="#water-canyon-again">Water Canyon Again</a></h4>
<p>The hike back out of Water Canyon was sobering.  Literally. so, when I
got back to the Water Canyon aid station for the second time, I did
have another <a href="https://www.gooseisland.com/goose-ipa">beer</a>.  This time
I only had half so someone else could have the other half.</p>
<p>Fairly close to the finish I asked Jeanne if she knew where Barry was
“He’s in back of you?” “Are you sure?” that was a foolish question,
but I didn’t know that he too had chosen to run this event much slower
than he could.</p>
<h3 id="finish"><a class="header" href="#finish">Finish</a></h3>
<p>As I approached the finish, I remembered the year when I tripped and
fell with less than a quarter of a mile to go.  I remembered the first
year when the finish line seemed to never come.  I remembered the time
Jeff and I trained on Mt. Taylor and ran the second lap in reverse.
I was excited to finish for the tenth time.  I briefly wondered where
the years went, but soon I was with fellow finishers, the organizers
and volunteers.  I was home.</p>
<h3 id="post-race"><a class="header" href="#post-race">Post Race</a></h3>
<p>As always, the post-race celebration was festive.  There were
many stories to hear and people to cheer on.  I had initially planned
on heading home early since I had balloon crewing the following day,
but that would have meant not seeing Crystal finish. In retrospect, I
can’t even believe I had even thought about leaving before helping
tear down.</p>
<p>I drove back to Albuquerque with the bed of my truck filled with garbage
bags and my head filled with inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="the-future"><a class="header" href="#the-future">The Future</a></h2>
<p>The Mt. Taylor 50k will cease to exist if substantial volunteers don’t
step up. I am hoping I can do more for the race in the future, but it
will be a relatively insignificant role.  Between Craft Poker Co. and
search-and-rescue (from which I’m currently on hiatus until
<a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a> launches) I will not have
time to do any serious organization, planning or management.  Trail
Marking and/or volunteering are more likely.</p>
