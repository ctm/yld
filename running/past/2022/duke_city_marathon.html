<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I ran
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/1458">4:59:51</a>,
<em>much</em> (i.e., nine seconds) too quickly.  My
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7974024108">miles</a> weren't
particularly consistent, either, with my fastest complete mile being
10:58 and my final .43 mile being 10:21.  My slowest mile was 12:01.</p>
<h2 id="practice"><a class="header" href="#practice">Practice</a></h2>
<p>I take my pacing seriously.  In the week before DCM, I did four 4.0
mile test runs, where my goal was to run an 11:27 pace for exactly 4
miles. I hit my goal each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7946619899">45:56</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7952148780">45:56</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7957238032">45:54</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7961958284">45:54</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used two GPS watches, one showing my my overall average pace and the
other showing me my instantaneous pace.  The problem is that neither
watch gives me a particularly accurate instantaneous pace, but with
both watches and practice I can do fairly well.</p>
<h2 id="sign-up"><a class="header" href="#sign-up">Sign-Up</a></h2>
<p>I got to run this for free, so I don't want to sound like I'm whining,
but there always seems to be additional complication doing this as a
pacer, because instead of using an online form to register, I got a
PDF which I then filled out and submitted to Glenda which she then
submitted to the Duke City Marathon people.</p>
<p>Just as I was approaching the Spotted Dog Brewery I got a text message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Clifford, this is [redacted] with the Duke City Marathon. We received your form, but there is no race checked off. Can you please let me know which race you would like to run</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a light I responded with </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Marathon. I'm the 5 hour pace group leader&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't attempt to look up my details while I was away from home
(doing the <a href="tortugas_mountain_2022.html">Tortugas 24 Hour Challenge</a>).
Race morning I wanted to see how people could track me and I found I
was listed as &quot;Cliff&quot;, not &quot;Clifford&quot; as I had written on the form and
as I was messaged. Even worse, my age was listed as 42.  These
differences don't matter to me personally, but streamlining and
bug-fixing the pacer process might allow DCM to get more pacers in the
future.</p>
<h2 id="weather"><a class="header" href="#weather">Weather</a></h2>
<p>On Friday morning, before I left for Las Cruces (returning Saturday
evening), I had already checked the DCM race-day weather and saw that
it was going to be low fifties, winds around twenty five miles per
hour and rain.  Wind (except when it's a tailwind) is always annoying,
especially when carrying a sign, but my big worry was that I am used
to dressing lightly and speeding up to keep my body warm.  As a pacer,
it's my duty to keep a steady pace.  So I set aside a long sleeve
shirt, a fleece hat, light rain jacket, gloves and hand warmers for
race day morning.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre-Race</a></h2>
<p>My alarm went off at 4:30 and I downed a double espresso that I had
made previously.  Almost every other day I have my double espresso at
5:15, but I wanted to make sure I had plenty of time to poop before
driving to the convention center.</p>
<p>I ate a 533 calorie serving of my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt">fortified
oatmeal</a>
at 4:45.  If it hadn't been for the weather, I'd have probably just
started the race in a fasted state, since I can run or bike slowly for
several hours in that state. However, I didn't want to risk it, since
it was my duty to keep a steady pace.</p>
<p>I got to the convention center parking lot with plenty of time to spare.
I made my way to the Albuquerque Road Runners bag drop to pick up my bib
and sign.  I chatted a bit with Dennis and Glenda and as time passed, I
decided to ditch more and more of my rain gear.  Eventually I decided to
use the hand warmers (because they're trivial to throw away if they get
annoying) and to tie my rain jacket around my waist.</p>
<p>As usual, the Road Runners had a huge bowl of tiny Tootsie Rolls an as
usual, I ate a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>At some point, I Judy (see below) introduced herself to me and let me know
she was going to run around my pace because she was training for an upcoming
fifty miler. Yay! Go Judy!</p>
<p>I met
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/274">Andrew</a>,
the 3:45 pace group leader and
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/1459">Nick</a>,
the 4:00 pace group leader.  We chatted a bit about running, then
headed out to hold up our signs so people could find us.</p>
<p>Days after finishing DCM, I looked up Nick on UltraSignup and saw that
he had come in
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=80566#id1112065">3rd</a>!
(just after <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Luke&amp;lname=Nelson&amp;age=41">Luke
Nelson</a>!)
in the <a href="https://www.plain100.com/">Plain 100</a> in 2021.  I am not
worthy; I suck at navigating (although I'm <a href="https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524">OK with a pack)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-race"><a class="header" href="#the-race">The Race</a></h2>
<h3 id="first-half"><a class="header" href="#first-half">First Half</a></h3>
<p>As usual, I was a chatterbox in the first half.  I volunteered a lot
of advice to anyone willing to listen or who was stuck nearby.  I
tried to emphasize that people are different and that I don't
necessarily know what I'm doing, and I tried to add some
self-deprecating remarks, but <a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/louse-seeing-one-ladys-bonnet-church/">who
knows?</a></p>
<p>I tried to get names and stories from people running with me, but I didn't
take notes after the race and so I've already forgotten many details.  Four
people I do remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/189">Judy</a>, an ultra runner with an upcoming 50 miler</li>

</ul>
<p>In the first mile I mentioned that I think the shorter the distance a
race is, the harder it is.  I elaborated to Chris, by mentioning that
<em>typically</em> goals change due to the distance. i.e., when you're
sprinting, your only goal is to finish as quickly as possible; when
you're running a marathon your goal tends to be to PR and/or correct
previous mistakes, but when running an ultra often your only goal is
to finish.</p>
<p>Judy and I talked a little bit about ultra-running before she got ahead
of me.</p>
<p>Before too long, Michael and I traded story after story. That may have been
boring (or worse!) for the others, but we didn't care; we were clicking off
miles and having a great day. As the turn-around approached, Michael bid me
goodbye, knowing that he was going to run the second half a little slower.</p>
<p>I noticed Gus, but at this point he wasn't part of the conversation and
I didn't know whether he was deliberately running our pace or if he
just happened to be there.  In retrospect, heh!</p>
<h3 id="second-half"><a class="header" href="#second-half">Second Half</a></h3>
<p>After the turnaround, I saw the 13 mile sign, checked my GPS watch and saw
that it said 13.18 miles. Uh oh. That's a big enough discrepancy that a
11:27 pace is not going to get me to the finish line in five hours. Although
I'd like to hit five hours exactly, I'd rather finish slightly early than 
slightly late, because if anyone is following me and wants to get sub five,
they may not think about the fact that it's chip timed and they may have
started in front of me, in which case they need to finish in front of me
too.  Being early just exacerbates that problem.</p>
<p>Since there was a little bit of a tailwind, I chose to speed up a
little bit and bring my average pace to around 11:24.  I also decided
that I should probably ingest some calories, since I hadn't eaten or
drank anything since the race started.  I had five gels with me and
planned on eating three, but I accidentally got four out, so that's
what I ate.  Tearing open the packets and making sure not to
accidentally drop anything while holding the &quot;5:00&quot; sign was an
exercise in clumsiness, but I got it done.</p>
<p>Before too long I started having a cup of water at some of the aid
stations.  I'm a firm believer in drinking only when I'm thirsty and I
hadn't been thirsty up until then. Between it getting warmer, me
having more miles on my legs and the gels (at least two of the four
were caffeinated), I got slightly thirsty, so I drank a little here
and there.</p>
<p>As I ran westward on Paseo del Norte I ran into Judy.  Looking at my
splits, I now know I was running about a 10:57 minute/mile pace.  At
the time I knew I was running faster than 11:27 because I was trying
go get down to 11:24 overall.  If I had confidence in the mile marking
and my math, I might have tried to run a little slower, but I figured
if I was going to make a mistake and run a little too quickly, doing
so here, with the tailwind and before everyone was hitting the wall
would be best.</p>
<p>Not too long after turning south on the Bosque Bike Path, I had a
chance to chat with
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/397">Julie</a>,
a <a href="http://www.50statesmarathonclub.com/">50 states</a> member who plans
to finish in Hawaii.  She told me how many states she had left and I
think it was eight.  I believe she's hoping to finish three or four a
year.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it wasn't too long after chatting with Julie
that I started talking with Chris again. Eventually I confessed to be
working on poker software and we chatted a bit about that.
Unfortunately, I got wrapped up in the conversation and let my pace
gradually speed up.  I don't know if it was due to my increased pace,
but Chris developed a cramp at some point and I didn't see him again,
although looking at the results I see he (5:20:58) and Julie (5:20:53)
finished within five seconds of each other. Neat!</p>
<p>I sort of thought I was all alone, except the quiet guy was still
there.  I think it was around twenty miles in when I started chatting
him up.  He seemed to be breathing a bit hard, so initially I expected
him to drop off, but it turns out he had been deliberately following me
because he had indeed wanted to finish sub five.</p>
<p>Eventually I learned this formerly silent guy was Gus. What I didn't
know until after the race was over is that my ultra running friend
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/339">John
Hancock</a>
had pointed Gus at me.  Gus had found John through Strava and when
John heard that Gus wanted to run sub five he pointed me out.  I had
seen John before the race start and he even mentioned that he had sent
someone my way, but at the time Gus wasn't around, so I didn't know
whom he had sent.</p>
<p>One of the markers—23, I think—toward the end of the
course agreed with my watch.  This was a little disconcerting, because
most of the previous ones had all been around .2 miles further than my
watch was claiming I had run.  If this new one was correct, then I've
been running much too fast, so once again I slowed down a bit, only to
get to find the next sign about .2 miles further than my GPS watch
said. D'oh!</p>
<p>I don't know for sure what was happening with the signs. I believe
courses are supposed to be measured by running a wheel along the
shortest distance within the cones and I most definitely wasn't
running the tangents.  However, at one point—25, I
think—the marathon and half marathon distance signs were fairly
close to each other and since the rest of the course was shared, that
couldn't be right, because they should be a tenth of a mile apart.</p>
<p>With less than a mile to go I encouraged Gus to run ahead so that he
would lock down his sub-five (which he did with a 4:59:38 finish).  I was
alone and trying to adjust my speed to take into consideration how much
further I thought might be left in both distance and time.  Someone saw
me approaching him and shouted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and sped up.  He was going for sub-five. I occasionally shouted
&quot;Run!&quot;  at him because I didn't want him to be caught short by the
chip timing.</p>
<h2 id="post-race"><a class="header" href="#post-race">Post Race</a></h2>
<p>As I approached the finish line it was clear I was going to finish too
quickly.  I slowed down to add a few seconds, but I didn't want to
slow too much (much less come to a complete stop) in order to finish
closer to 5:00:00. This was not the year to beat my record of being
only three seconds off.</p>
<p>Glenda found me after crossing the finish line as did John Hancock.
That's when I learned that Gus had been sent by John.  I returned to
the ARR bag drop area and fetched some recovery food (another serving
of fortified oatmeal) and beverages (<a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/rice_milk.txt">rice
milk</a>
and a <a href="https://tumblerootbreweryanddistillery.com/beer/sunset-hazy-ipa/">Best Energy Electrolyte
Replacement</a>).</p>
<p>I hung around the bag drop area until they were ready to tear down
most of it.  I then helped schlep some of the gear to Dennis's car
before driving over to Marcia's and Jeff's where the fed and beveraged
me.</p>

<p>This was my fourth time leading the five hour pace group. I started doing it in
2017 and decided to do it every year, but there was no DCM in 2020 due to
covid and the Albuquerque Road Runners didn't supply pace group leaders in
2021, so my streak is sort of unbroken.</p>

</ul>
<p>My goal was to run a steady 4:27 minute / mile and then to adjust my
speed in the last quarter to half mile to cross the timing mat at
exactly 5:00:00.  This was a little tricky because my GPS watch wasn't
necessarily going to agree on the distance in the best of circumstances,
but especially with this year's mile marker placements.</p>
<p>I was a little nervous running a 24 hour race the day before (i.e. the
end of the 24-hour event was thirteen hours before the start of DCM),
although I did have precedent for running a big event the day
before. Although in 2017, I hadn't run anything since the Mt. Taylor
50k three weeks and a day prior, in 2018 I ran the White Mesa 50k the
day before and in 2019 I ran the Sandia Crossing Marathon 7:24:30 the
day before.  It's not that I deliberately look for events to do the
day before the Duke City Marathon, it's just that running at an 11:27
min/mile pace is not that challenging.</p>
<p>So, this year, when I found that the Tortugas Mountain 24 Hour
Challenge was being held in Las Cruces the day before, I chose to do
the challenge, but enter the non-drinking division and cap my miles at
60 (or 64). Initially I had also planned on not drinking during Tortugas
Mountain, but I changed my mind and simply drank considerably less and
delayed my celebratory drinking until post DCM.</p>
<p>It all worked out fine, but the drive back from Las Cruces was a bit
nerve-racking, because I didn't know when I'd get to sleep, how well
I'd sleep or how fit I would feel in the morning.  Turns out, I got to
bed late, slept poorly, felt great and had no trouble performing my
pacing duties.</p>
<h2 id="pix"><a class="header" href="#pix">Pix</a></h2>
<p>I participate in so many events that it's exceedingly rare that I buy
photos (especially since some events provide photos for free), but
Foggy Bay Photos was out taking pictures and
<a href="https://thefoggybay.shootproof.com/gallery/19549154/search?q=1458">here</a>
are the ones they took of me.</p>
<h2 id="more-to-add-later"><a class="header" href="#more-to-add-later">More to Add, Later</a></h2>
<p>All told, I took 800mg of ibuprofen: 400mg around 4:45am, with my
fortified oatmeal and another 400mg soon after having my gels, just past
the turnaround.</p>
<p>The first amount of ibuprofen was to counter any minor discomfort that
might show up due to my participation in the Tortugas Mountain 24-Hour
Challenge.  The latter was due to minor discomfort that I was feeling
in my knees, that I <em>think</em> was due to the way carrying a sign altered
my gait.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is a tricky subject, so my plan is to eventually create a
section of this book that explains when I use it and why and also
mentions some of the risks.  I've had at least two good friends of
mine go to the hospital for kidney failure due, in part, to overuse
of ibuprofen. So, rather than mentioning that in this race report,
I'll eventually take the time to mention it in the upcoming <code>Ibuprofen</code>
section of my upcoming <code>Drugs</code> section of my upcoming <code>Practices</code> section.</p>
<p>I don't know when I'll get to the above. I do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz0EdL8TyT4">Day
Job</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Yeah, I'll add a <code>Grateful Dead</code> section too; I was lucky enough
to go to many shows back in the day, including this one.</p>
