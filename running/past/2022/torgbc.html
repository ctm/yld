<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.torgbc.com/">Tour of the Rio Grande</a> is a bicycle event
that offers many different ride distances.  I chose to ride the
Century (100 miles). I had done this event in 2019 and wanted to do it
again, but it wasn't offered in 2020 and although it reappeared in
2021, it escaped my notice.  As centuries go, it's fairly easy in that
there's very little elevation change, but it's well done and is
surprisingly social considering the fact that they don't have a
post-ride beer garden.</p>
<p>It's not a race and—<em>temporarily</em>—being short of cash, I
chose to use the rest stop food rather than use Tailwind in my water
bottles.  That meant I stopped five times.  I'm also a big baby when
it comes to traffic, so I took a lot more time
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7867294235">6:49:23</a>) to finish
this supported 100 mile ride than I did on my last unsupported rest
day 100 miler
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7298799302">6:07:31</a>).</p>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>I chose to ride ToRG for a few reasons. </p>
<p>One is that my brother-in-law has gotten into biking and he and I were
going to ride some centuries this year, but he got injured. So,
although our centuries together are deferred to next year, I was
already looking forward to &quot;them&quot;.  In reality, although <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7187704802">I
rode</a> the <a href="https://www.santafecentury.com/">Santa Fe
Century</a> earlier this year, I
probably won't be riding the <a href="https://dayofthetread.com/">Day of the
Tread</a> Century a month from now, because
it conflicts with the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road
Runners</a> &quot;<a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/forever-young-run.html">Forever
Young</a>&quot;
footrace.</p>
<p>Two, in theory, I run six days week and ride my bike on Sundays.  In
reality, I often skip the bike ride because I'm a fair weather rider,
especially after going over the handlebars due to me overly applying
the break when coming up on black ice.  Today, however, was good weather,
so sure!</p>
<p>Three, I plan on running the Tortugas Mountain 24 hour race in Las
Cruces on a Friday evening before returning to Albuquerque and then
being the five hour pace group leader for the Duke City Marathon on
the following Sunday, so by &quot;running&quot; (cough!) the AA 50k on Friday
evening and then riding the Tour of the Rio Grande the following
Sunday, I was able to make sure that the timing worked.</p>
<h2 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h2>
<h3 id="off-course-briefly"><a class="header" href="#off-course-briefly">Off course briefly</a></h3>
<p>Before the tour started, I ran into my friend Bill Dyea from search
and rescue.  We chatted a bit which was nice, but perhaps I should
have used a little of that time to review the cue sheet, because I did
miss one turn, the one going back east on Rio Bravo.</p>
<p>When I got to that intersection, I thought I was supposed to turn, but
I looked carefully and didn't see any signs.  Perhaps there was no
sign, because the turn is &quot;obvious&quot;, but I wasn't sure if there was a
&quot;backdoor&quot; route that avoided Rio Bravo in the early afternoon when it
was really busy.  It's also possible that there had been a sign and it
was removed or that it was still there and I just didn't look in the
right place.</p>
<p>So, without seeing a sign and having a green light, I crossed Rio
Bravo. But shortly after getting to the other side I stopped, got my
bicycle out of traffic, turned on my phone, brought the course up on
Gaia, saw that I made a mistake, then backtracked back to Rio Bravo
and got back on course.</p>
<h3 id="trains-werent-bad-this-year"><a class="header" href="#trains-werent-bad-this-year">Trains weren't bad this year</a></h3>
<p>Unlike three years ago, I only had to wait briefly at a train track crossing.
There was indeed a train on the rails when I got to the infamous crossing,
but it was a relatively short train and half of it had already passed.</p>
<h3 id="roadkill-was"><a class="header" href="#roadkill-was">Roadkill was</a></h3>
<p>There was a ton of roadkill out.  I must have seen at least a half
dozen dead raccoons, two or three skunks, a couple of dead porcupines
and even a coyote.  Although I don't recall seeing as much roadkill
three years ago, two data points isn't enough to draw any conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked"><a class="header" href="#signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked">Signs definitely could be overlooked</a></h3>
<p>Other than perhaps a sign marking the Rio Bravo turn, I didn't miss
any signs that marked the course, but many people did miss the turn
for the first aid station.  That aid station is at the Las Lunas
Railrunner (the local &quot;commuter&quot; train) station, but you have to take
a left turn (on the way out) to get there.  It's at about mile
nineteen, but luckily (for the people who missed it), the second aid
station is at about mile 31.</p>
<h3 id="bad-drunk-driver"><a class="header" href="#bad-drunk-driver">Bad (drunk?) Driver</a></h3>
<p>As I was north riding on Isleta and approaching Gun Club, I saw a driver
turn left from Gun Club and swing so far into the bike lane that his tires
were inches from hitting the curb.  The driver then overcompensated and
swung past the left boundary of the lane before eventually settling into
the middle.  I was in no danger of being hit, because I was well behind,
and I doubt that the driver would have swung that wide had I been in the
way, because a bicyclist is larger than a curb, but … drivers still
scare me.</p>
<h3 id="too-much-caffeine"><a class="header" href="#too-much-caffeine">Too much caffeine</a></h3>
<p>Knowing that I was going to be stopping at all the aid stations and
that traffic (potentially including a train) might also slow me down,
I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to finish the ride in
the allotted seven hours, so … I drank a quad espresso just
before starting and another quad espresso at mile 50.  Perhaps that
was not a good choice, because I'm going to have a fair amount of
trouble sleeping at my normal time tonight.</p>
<h3 id="knee-held-up-nicely"><a class="header" href="#knee-held-up-nicely">Knee held up nicely</a></h3>
<p>I had injured my left knee when I fell at the Big Cottonwood Marathon
fifteen days ago.  My knee didn't give me any trouble at the AA 50k
Friday evening and it didn't give me any trouble on this century.
However, <em>right now</em> about seven hours after finishing, my knee is
complaining.</p>
<h3 id="music-as-a-crutch"><a class="header" href="#music-as-a-crutch">Music as a crutch</a></h3>
<p>ToRG doesn't allow people to ride with earbuds.  I don't think I'd
have used them even if I were allowed, because there's enough traffic
that I <em>really</em> want to be able to hear the cars behind me.  However,
this ride did suggest to me that I rely on the beat of music to speed
me up.  In the future, I should take that into consideration.</p>
