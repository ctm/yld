                        <h1 id="knees"><a class="header" href="#knees">Knees</a></h1>
<p>The following is how I think <em>my</em> knees work. I am not telling you how
your knees work.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-beginning"><a class="header" href="#in-the-beginning">In the beginning</a></h3>
<p>When I started running, one knee would always chirp at some distance.  As
time went on, that distance increased. Eventually it didn’t chirp (although
I did get orthotics, see below).</p>
<p>I fall a lot. Historically, that was due to either poor eyesight combined
with wearing sunglasses when I shouldn’t, or getting lost in thought.  Over
time I’ve taught myself to take off the sunglasses in dim light or even
in bright light with tricky shadows.  Although I’ve made some progress in
not getting lost in thought, it still happens.</p>
<p>In general, when I fall and scrape up my knee, there might be minor
discomfort in that knee for a day or two and the scab would be gone in
two weeks, leaving behind a veneer of scar tissue at worst.</p>
<h3 id="a-dozen-years-later"><a class="header" href="#a-dozen-years-later">A dozen years later</a></h3>
<p>On September 10th, 2022, however, I took a <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/past/2022/big_cottonwood_marathon.html#bam">pretty nasty
fall</a>
while running the Big Cottonwood Marathon.  That scab didn’t
completely disappear for five weeks and the external scar tissue
didn’t go away for about six months.  I had intermittent knee pain for
about four months, but I kept training and it fully resolved.</p>
<h3 id="orthotics"><a class="header" href="#orthotics">Orthotics</a></h3>
<p>When I was in eighth grade, I stress fractured a small bone inside my foot
when I was jumping out of a swing for distance.  My dad was in the Air Force,
so I had free medical care.  The foot doctor that I saw told me that I had
extremely high arches and that I needed custom orthotics or I wouldn’t be able
to walk when I was thirty.</p>
<p>The custom orthotics were made of some extremely hard plastic.  I was told
that the plastic would never break, but to be very careful if it did, because
it would be extremely sharp.  Within a year or two, using a spade, I broke
the orthotic, without cutting my foot.  The pieces were indeed fairly sharp.
I threw them away and never wore them, or any other orthotics, until after
I took up running.</p>
<p>So, the claim that I wouldn’t be able to walk when I was thirty was bogus.
However, when I took up hiking, I was having some knee pain and a friend of
mine introduced me to a woman who made custom orthotics.  She made some for
me and they seemed to help.  Eventually, after having worn through a pair or
two of her custom orthotics, I found she had retired, so I switched to another
orthotic maker.  I was his problem client. It took a bit of fiddling around
to get them just right, but I’ve been wearing his orthotics ever since.  He
is now mostly retired, but still sees some of his old clients.</p>
<p>At one point I decided to forego the custom orthotics because I really
didn’t know if they were working or if it was more akin to all the
ankle support I initially needed when I was hiking and in the
beginning of my running.  As my ankles got stronger, I needed less
support.  So, perhaps I didn’t need these “fancy” orthotics after all.
Without them (and it’s been so long since I experimented, that I can’t
remember if I went with no orthotics or off-the-shelf ones), my knee
discomfort returned.</p>
<p>From my point-of-view, it’s possible that if I had continued to train
without the custom orthotics that my knees would get used to it (or
the nocebo effect would wear off) and my discomfort would go away.
However, I also figure it’s possible that I’d do damage and I already
had the custom orthotics, so I went back to using them.</p>
<h3 id="possibly-incorrect-conclusions"><a class="header" href="#possibly-incorrect-conclusions">(Possibly incorrect) Conclusions</a></h3>
<p>I do not think my knees are “consumable.”  I do not think that
running— even with a pack—<i>the way I do it</i>, is
damaging <i>my</i> knees.  I believe that running strengthens my
knees.</p>
<p>I do believe that falling damages my knees and I really am trying to
fall less.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I know many people who have injured their knees
playing basketball or soccer and a few who have injured their knees
running.  I’ve torn a ligament in my left shoulder and I’m very glad
that I run on my legs and not my arms.</p>
<p>I do not wish knee damage on anyone.  I would hate for people to
emulate my behavior and damage their knees.  I am, however, quite glad
that I’ve continued training even when one of my knees (typically, the
one that I fell on most recently) “chirp”.</p>
<p>I’ll admit it: I don’t <em>know</em> how my knees work, but I have my
strong suspicions.  I don’t know if what I’m doing will eventually
catch up with me, but I’ve been <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March#bataan-memorial-death-march-training">training hard for the Bataan Memorial
Death
March</a>
(or a substitute in the years when it wasn’t held in person) for well
over ten years.  My training begins in mid November and lasts until
mid March.  During those months I’m <strong>running</strong> with my pack two or
more times a week most weeks.</p>
<h3 id="sunglasses-addendum"><a class="header" href="#sunglasses-addendum">Sunglasses Addendum</a></h3>
<p>In Silverton this year (2023), I bought a pair o sunglasses that were
designed for trail runners and specifically address the contrast
issue.  Unlike some of my fancier sunglasses from the past (when I had
ridiculous amounts of free cash), they are not photo-gray, but so far,
I’ve found them living up to their hype.  I wear them in situations
where I wouldn’t have worn my other pairs and I haven’t—knock
wood—fallen yet.</p>
<h3 id="unicycle-addendum"><a class="header" href="#unicycle-addendum">Unicycle Addendum</a></h3>
<p>This deserves its own page.</p>
<p>I started riding a unicycle at the end of June (the 28th, to be precise) 2023
after effectively a 30 year hiatus. I’m trying to ramp up my mileage so I can
ride a 100 mile event in Alaska at the end of March in 2024.</p>
<p>My knees were absolutely unprepared for this and although I didn’t get
knee discomfort while I was riding, There were times when I woke up in
the middle of the night with fairly intense knee pain (in just one
knee) that has lasted for about a half hour. Surprisingly, the pain
always diminished to discomfort and was typically gone by the time I
awoke.</p>
<p>This mystery pain happened a few days in a row, but never more than
three days in a row, if I remember correctly.  It was something I was paying
attention to, and I became concerned, but not worried.</p>
<p>However, when I had the trouble I <em>did not</em> back down my mileage; I
increased it and the problem went away. Eventually, however, I did
back down my mileage, but that had to do with my right foot healing up
and me wanting to do <em>a lot</em> more running to regain some the fitness I lost
(and to lose some of the weight I gained).</p>
<p>So, AFAICT, unicycling put different stresses on my knees than running had
and my body adapted to them.  Yay.</p>
