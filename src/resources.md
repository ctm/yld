# Resources

Exceedingly little of what I do is anything I have thought up myself.
At best, some of the things I do are a synthesis of what others do,
kind of like my [fortified
oatmeal](https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt)
being a mixture of food that I think is good for me that tastes great
when mixed together.

Over the years I've read many books, blog posts, and web articles as
well as simply asked questions of people with much more experience
than I.  I didn't, however, take notes on what I've read or what
people have answered, so this Resources section is going to be my
usual hodge-podge of stuff that I think of when I'm spending a few
minutes jotting things down.

### Couch to 5k

The [Couch to 5k
program](https://marathonhandbook.com/couch-to-5k-training-plan/) is
worth mentioning even though I never did it. However, the people who
started the BARGE Fun Run did and that's what inspired them.  The
BARGE Fun Run inspired me.  After seeing me finish my first marathon,
my brother-in-law thought "If Cliff can do it, how hard can it be?"
and decided to run a marathon as well.  He, however, on my advice, did
use the Couch to 5k program.  Not only did he finish the 2010 Chicago
Marathon, but he's gone on and done a variety of ultras, including the
Leadville Trail 100.  So, Couch to 5k is pretty worthwhile.
