# AGDGAT

After the ADGD remote meeting finishes, a subset of members join for an
accountability meeting.  The premise is simple, each member briefly describes
the work that member did in the previous week, specifically compared to
the prediction that member made at the last meeting.  Congratulations,
sympathy, understanding and words of encouragement are provided and then
that member makes a prediction for the following week.  The predictions
are tracked on a spreadsheet.

I'm enjoying this process, even though I've fallen short more times
than I've exceeded my goals.
