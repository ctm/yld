# AGDG

I joined the [Albuquerque Game Developers Guild](https://agdg.co/) in
the middle of 2021, but before that I had known one of the co-founders
for years and he's one of the friendliest people I know. Not
surprisingly, the group he co-founded is also welcoming.

When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so I'm not a complete rando crashing their party.
