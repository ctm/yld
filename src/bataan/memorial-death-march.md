# Memorial Death March

For now, most of my Bataan Memorial Death March material is in [its
own GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March#bataan-memorial-death-march-training). However,
I'm honored to be the face of civilian heavy, both on the
[registration
page](https://bataanmarch.com/register/civilian-individual/) and a
[Facebook post from January
13th](https://www.facebook.com/BataanMemorialDeathMarch/photos/a.796638007052611/5611252238924473/).
