# Memorial Death March

For now, most of my Bataan Memorial Death March material is in [its
own GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March#bataan-memorial-death-march-training). However,
I'm honored to be the face of civilian heavy, both on the
[registration
page](https://bataanmarch.com/register/civilian-individual/) and a
[Facebook post from January
13th, 2023](https://www.facebook.com/BataanMemorialDeathMarch/photos/a.796638007052611/5611252238924473/).

#### Welcome Back

The last pre-covid year the Bataan Memorial Death March was held in
person was 2019.  That year our twin daughters were fourteen years and
a half years old. They and my wife did the Honorary (fourteen and a
half! mile) course.

The 2020 edition of the Bataan Memorial Death March was canceled less
than a week before it was to happen.  Covid was fairly new, but the
organizers chose to err on the side of caution.  There was no attempt
to hold an in-person BMDM in 2021, but they did provide a virtual
substitute.  The BMDM was to have been held both virtually and in
person in 2022, but the in-person event was scuttled.

In 2023, the event returned to White Sands Missile Range and both our
twins and I did the full. Iris, still in high school at the time, was
in the Civilian Light division. Margaret, then a freshman at the
University of New Mexico, was part of a five person ROTC light team.
Once again, I competed in Civilian Heavy. Jeff, my brother-in-law,
walked the Civlian Light.
