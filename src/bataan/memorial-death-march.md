# Memorial Death March

For now, most of my Bataan Memorial Death March material is in [its
own GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March#bataan-memorial-death-march-training). However,
I'm honored to be the face of civilian heavy, both on the
[registration
page](https://bataanmarch.com/register/civilian-individual/) and a
[Facebook post from January
13th](https://www.facebook.com/BataanMemorialDeathMarch/photos/a.796638007052611/5611252238924473/).

#### It's been a while

The last time the Bataan Memorial Death March was held in person
was 2019.  That year my twin daughters were fourteen years old. They,
and my wife did the Honorary fourteen mile course.  This year, both
twins are doing the full: Iris, who is still in high school, is
already registered in the Civilian Light division. Margaret, who is a
freshman at the University of New Mexico, will be registering as part
of a five person ROTC team.  I'm registered for Civilian Heavy and my
brother-in-law is registered for Civlian Light.
