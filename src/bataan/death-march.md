# Death March

Here are a few books that document the Bataan Death March or other atrocities in the Philippines:

* [Bataan Death March: A Soldier's Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/693429.Bataan_Death_March)[^1]
* [Ghost Soldiers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94799.Ghost_Soldiers)
* [Last Man Out](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/572131.Last_Man_Out)
* [No Uncle Sam](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1493007.No_Uncle_Sam)
* [Some Survived](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/693426.Some_Survived)
* [Tears in the Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6455003-tears-in-the-darkness)[^2]
* [The Naked Soldier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29506650-the-naked-soldier)[^3]

There is at least one very important book missing from that list.  I
met the author and she gave me one of her copies.  She is the daughter
of a Bataan Death March survivor.  One of my daughter's currently has
the book.  There are sufficiently few copies of the book that I don't
think it appears on Goodreads.

[^1] The author, [James
Bollich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HD6eEcViU), was one of the
two Bataan Death March survivors to speak at the Bataan **Memorial**
Death March in 2019. The other was [Ben
Skardon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgovVp4pM70).

[^2]: Ben Steele is the protagonist.

[^3]: Jesse was in his nineties and still working when he addressed
his audience at the White Sands Missile Range. He was [95 when he
died](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/filipino-wwii-veterans-advocate-survivor-bataan-death-march-falls-cancer-n558256). As
mentioned in his obituary, he did not like the [Recission
Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescission_Act_of_1946).
