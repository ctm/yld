# Music

I like listening to music as I run. The vast majority of the time I
simply listen to songs at random from my iPod's large library.  I get
the runner's high fairly easily and when that's kicked in, the music
and lyrics pull me in different directions.  The randomness is like a
washing machine for my mind.

I do, however, have several playlists, and I've included
approximations of my three different "speed" (high cadence,
motivating) ones here.  I use [Speed
3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHB06ix3lYik1aF8qZpFQN3A1QAtzTFu)
when I'm doing interval training, [Speed
9](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHB06ix3lYi8vGSquJSyLpUsTSViG21n)
when I'm running as quickly as I can for a distance anywhere from six
miles to thirteen and a half and my [Bataan Memorial Death
March](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHB06ix3lYgdhd6NgF-zde9tpLh81wsU)
(BMDM) playlist when I'm doing my Saturday BMDM training or when I'm
racing a marathon trying to qualify for the Boston Marathon or otherwise 
do well for my age.

Although not as fast as Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, I also run fairly
quickly to
[Professor Longhair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj6AXu7_psY) and
the faster tunes of
[Klezmatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmf3hY7QnTg).

My favorite runner's song, however, is [Runner's
High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Ht2MLJD8U) by the pillows.

Special mention of [The Impression That I
Get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIGMUAMevH0), because I'm sure it
isn't good.
