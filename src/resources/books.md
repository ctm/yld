# Books

This list is currently unordered and contains no reviews.  Eventually,
I _might_ explain what I think I got out of each book, but for now
this is a super quick, nowhere near exhaustive, brain dump.  In fact, I
wrote this while away from home, so I wasn't even able to glance at my
bookshelf to fill in gaps.
