# Books

This list is currently alphabetically ordered and contains no reviews.
Eventually, I _might_ explain what I think I got out of each book, but
for now this is a super quick, nowhere near exhaustive, brain dump.
Although I've used my bookshelf to remind me of the various books I've
read, I have a habit of giving books away (want a book? just ask), so
I'm sure some have slipped through the cracks.
