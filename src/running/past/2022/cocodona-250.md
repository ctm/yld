# Cocodona 250

## Overview

I finished in
[111:55:01](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=85868#id220546). It
was epic, but I wasn't writing race reports back then.

[A picture of me](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnZx_eIp9em/) has been
posted to Instagram (it's the second of three, so you have to click
the right arrow to see it).

I do plan on retroactively writing a C250 2022 race report. Just before
the start of C250 2023 I added some notes to my C250 2022 Strava Activities.
