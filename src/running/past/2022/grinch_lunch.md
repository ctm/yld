# Grinch Lunch

The [Grinch
Lunch](https://www.facebook.com/events/1307112846691234) is the
second stop on the [Burque Brew
Tour](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/burque-brewery-tour.html). This
year, however, I chose not to drink any alcohol from November 28th,
2022 (the day after I turned sixty) until June 25th, the day I assume
I'll finish [Western States](https://www.wser.org/). So, I raced and
socialized but didn't drink.

Similar to the [Black Friday Turkey Trots](black_friday.md), Piggy
Style ran with me initially, barely breaking a sweat while I pushed
fairly hard.  Once again, I knew I was beat and so I ran fast enough
to clinch second, but not _painfully_ fast.

The weather was excellent, so people gathered together outside to
relax in the sunny final day of the year. I got to catch up a bit with
several of the [Albuquerque Road
Runners](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/). I also had a chance to plug
the upcoming [Foothills Fat
Ass](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/foothills-50k/) runs and
chat a little with the founders of that tradition.

My official time was [22:28.7](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=301215&did=361733).
