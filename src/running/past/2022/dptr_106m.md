# Deadman Peaks 106 miler 2022

## Overview

It was chilly in temperature, but warm in atmosphere or perhaps that
was the two Santa Fe Brewing [7k IPA](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1683/289386/)s and the shot of Dewar's Whisky
that I had at the halfway point.

I [got 'er done](https://www.strava.com/activities/8080161623), but
chose not write up a race report until after I've written up my JJ100
adventure.  And _that's_ the downside to running a hundred miler six
days after finishing a hundred miler: no time to write race reports.

My official time was
[32:49:00](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=92315#id220546)
finishing seventh of the nine finishers, another thirteen started but
did not finish and six did not start.

Oh, and [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/8093196178) happened.
