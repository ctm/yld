# Feral Hog 50k Rucksack 2022

## Overview

I was the only rucker, so I finished first and DFL. My official time was
[7:39:12.6](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=293591&did=350019&cid=1738637&gender=M)

## Why?

I normally don't like to do events during Balloon Fiesta. I make an exception
for the Mt. Taylor 50k (this year, 2016) and once for Canyon de Chelly (2014),
but my plan is to do some serious ruck racing after I turn 60 and I decided
this would be a good training.

In fact, I thought that having an actual race hanging over my head
would keep me from drinking too much alcohol and eating too much junk
food during Balloon Fiesta (unlike last year).  That most definitely
didn't happen. Race day came with me hoping there wouldn't be any
serious competition so I would not have to push myself.

Turns out, there were no other ruckers, so all I had to do was finish before
the cutoff to get first place, although if I finished within nine hours
(according to the website) or eight hours (the time limit I was told when
I had five miles to go) I'd get a Feral Flask.

## Reprieve?

On Wednesday, three days before the race, Mary and Mike (the race directors)
sent an email with the subject

> Trails Currently Un-runnable - Warning Order for Possible Race Cancellation

It explained that there has been an unseasonably large amount of rain and
that the trail couldn't safely be marked.  Knowing that the weather forecast
was for more rain, I thought it would be canceled, and I ate and drink on
Wednesday as if I had dodged a bullet.

However Thursday morning we were updated:

> Feral Hog is a go!!

What wound up happening was a compromise.  The first half of the 25k
was substituted for the second half of the 50k.  This may have made
the course a little tougher, because the second half had less
elevation change, I think.

## Team RWB

Three fellow Team RWB members (Roleen, Rhoda and Brianna) were
volunteering and one was running the 25k (Kathy).  I haven't done
much with Team RWB lately, so that made seeing them especially
sentimental.

## Rain

It did indeed rain all day, although there was never a downpour.  At it's
lightest it was basically a mist.  At its heaviest it was constant, but not
pelting.  I heard thunder only once and never saw lightning.

The rain did necessitate me running with the rain-cover on my pack.
That made access to my pack's contents sufficiently awkward that I
only got into it once, at the halfway point.  I had a temperature
sensitive toothache and the hot miso I was drinking was irritating it.
To get to my ibuprofen I had to untie my belt, take the pack off, set
it somewhere stable, remove a couple straps that held the rain-cover
on, and unzip a side pocket.  The "somewhere stable" is a little
tricky, because even though the pack itself only weighed a little more
than twenty pounds, that could have been enough to push over one of
the lightweight poles holding up the canopy over the smaller aid
station.

So, the rain was annoying in and of itself, however&hellip;

## Mud

The mud was worse than the rain.  Some of the mud was caliche, which can be
super slippery and can also stick to shoes, adding weight and weird padding.
This race was one of the few times I half-heartedly wished I had a video
camera recording some of the terrain.  It was nuts.

Since there was little time pressure on me, I slowed down quite a bit
anywhere the footing was dicey.  I still managed to fall in the mud
once, when I simply underestimated the slope and slipperiness of my
path.  Sure enough, I wound up with some caliche mud stuck to my leg
for the rest of the race (and the drive home).

## Chafing

I normally wear two panty liners on my back when rucking at speed.
These both lessen the chafing and suck up extra blood from chafing.
However, when training I put them on using a mirror and at the Bataan
Memorial Death March I have someone else apply them.  For this event,
I did it myself, without a mirror and may not have gotten one of them
positioned where it would do the most good.

I also had to take my pack off at an aid station so it could be
weighed.  I'm pretty sure one of my pads shifted when I did that,
because I did get enough chafing afterward to slow me down.  It's not
excruciating to have a pack sliding up and down on raw flesh, but it
something I feel with each step and the faster I run the more I feel
it, so there were sections of the course in the second half where I
could have run faster but chose not to.

## Too Much Salt?

There was plenty for me to eat, and each aid station had hot miso.  It
was about fifty degrees Fahrenheit and raining, so I had plenty of
miso at each stop. I don't know why, but pretzels were especially
appealing to me, so each time I left an aid station I grabbed a
handful of them.

As the event progressed, my fingers, and later my hands, started
swelling.  At the end, when the race directors were considering
throwing out the remaining miso, I volunteered to drink the amount my
finisher's cup would hold.  By then my swelling was pronounced, but I
knew I had peed regularly and figured that I'd pee even more since I
also had a beer and twenty-four ounces of rice milk.

This is the first time I have had significant swelling in a long time.
I assume it was from all the salt I was consuming.  I don't normally
take salt supplements, although I often drink some Tailwind as I run.
Lately I've been too broke to keep buying Tailwind and this course had
free Heed, but I don't like heed, so most of my liquid was miso, and
the liquid in pickles.  I started with about fifty ounces of water in
my bladder, but only drank about ten ounces of it; I wasn't sweating
much considering my slow pace, relatively lightweight pack and the
constant cool rain.

Other than the swelling, I had no discomfort and although I was going
slowly due to chafing and mud, I was not sluggish.  So I don't think I
had hyponatremia or kidney or liver trouble.  The fact that the
swelling decreased steadily after the race was over reinforces my
belief that I wasn't at risk of injury due to the swelling, but it is
something I would have been concerned with if were only a quarter of
the way done with my race when my hands were as big as they were.
It's definitely something for me to watch in the future.

## An Excellent Event in Trying Circumstances

My hat is off to Mary and Mike.  They put on an excellent event with
very uncooperative weather.  Presumably it would have been much easier
for them to simply cancel than to do the reroute.  I am glad that they
didn't.  Race Directing is a hard work.  Putting on a race in New
Mexico immediately adjacent to the Mt. Taylor 50k has to be tough.  I
applaud the addition of this race to our locale.

## Previous Years

I was able to find links to the three previous Feral Hog 50k rucks that
were held in Ohio: 
* [2016](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=41824)
* [2017](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=44351)
* [2018](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=54837)

I do not know the area, but Wikipedia shows Batavia's elevation as 594
feet, but a [race report from
2018](https://ccie5851.blogspot.com/2018/) mentions hills, creek and
river crossings, and 1,618 feet of gain in the first 20.31 miles, so
the Ohio course _appears_ to be comparable to the New Mexico one (Ohio
having more water crosings, New Mexico being at a higher altitude).
