# Jemez Mountain Trail Run 50 Miler

People I met

pre-race dinner
Garret Euler -- 50k, relatively new to this, lives in Los Alamos
Larry Pearson -- is registered for both Western States and Hardrock in 2025
Jason Bousliman -- I was rude and brought up his Leadville failures, but
I meant it in a glowing way


going slowly into Mitchell (due to lack of water)
George Sefzik
with Scott Minas -- his first 50 miler
