# [AA 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/) 2022

## Overview

[AA 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/) is a night race
(starting at 7pm on a Friday) that normally consists of up to ten 3.3
mile loops around Albuquerque Academy.  It is open to people who wish
to do fewer. Back when we had thirty or so people starting, after
people had finished they'd be put in the division for the number of
laps they had completed and then, within that division, ranked based
on their finishing time.


It may be time to retire this race. We only had three starters: Jason Romero,
Mark Werkmeister and myself. Jason and I finished 31 miles seconds less
than eight hours.

## The "Race"

Mark was planning on doing _at most_ four laps (i.e., a half
marathon), but complication from his recent surgery limited his
participation to a little more than two laps (a bit more than a 10k).
Furthermore, Mark has not yet been cleared to run, so he was walking,
so Jason, Mark and I walked together initially.

About four tenths of a mile into his third loop, Mark let prudence 
turn him back toward his car so he could drive home. Although he had
been cleared by his doctor to walk and hike, his body was acting up
and telling him to stop. He listened.

Being lazy, Jason and I accompanied Mark back to his car before restarting
our third loop.  You might think that would have caused us to do an extra
eight tenths of a mile, but instead we decided to do only nine complete
laps, since with all the futzing around, we were at 31.03 miles by then.

Although we stuck together, my GPS watch said my time was
[7:59:45](https://www.strava.com/activities/7857963617), whereas
Jason's said his time was 7:59:47, so I stole the win!

## AA 50k Origin

AA 50k was added to the [Albuquerque Fat Ass
series](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/) in 2012 to give people
training for their first hundred miler a chance to run in the dark on
a familiar, accessible, tame, course.

## AA 50k Future

There's no longer a _need_ for AA 50k, so perhaps 2022 was its final
year.  The people for whom AA 50k was initially set up for now have a
decade of night running experience.  However, hundred milers continue
to gain popularity and there's a new stable of runners who might want
the stepping stone that AA 50k can provide.  If it is to be put on in
2023, a date will be chosen much
earlier and more will be done to increase attendance.
