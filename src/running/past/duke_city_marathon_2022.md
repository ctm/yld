# Duke City Marathon 2022

## Overview

TODO (after I actually finish)

## Historical

This is my fourth time leading the five hour pace group. I started doing it in
2017 and decided to do it every year, but there was no DCM in 2020 due to
covid and the Albuquerque Road Runners didn't supply pace group leaders in
2021, so my streak is sort of unbroken.

My goal is to run a steady 4:27 minute / mile and then to adjust my
speed in the last quarter to half mile to cross the timing mat at
exactly 5:00:00.  This is a little tricky because my GPS watch isn't
necessarily going to agree on the distance, and I don't want to cheat
by getting close to the timing mat and completely stopping.  So, my
worst was nineteen seconds too late and my best was three seconds
late.

In 2017, I hadn't run anything since the Mt. Taylor 50k 6:three weeks and a day
prior.  However, in 2018 I ran the White Mesa 50k the day before and in
2019 I ran the Sandia Crossing Marathon 7:24:30 the day before.  It's not that
I deliberately look for events to do the day before the Duke City Marathon, it's
just that running at an 11:27 min/mile pace is not that challenging.

So, this year, when I found that the Tortugas Mountain 24 Hour Challenge was
being held in Las Cruces the day before, I chose to do the challenge, but
enter the non-drinking division and cap my miles at 60 (or 64).  That should
allow me to get a fairly good night's sleep and still be a reliable pacer.
