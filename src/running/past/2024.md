# 2024

I got a little behind in writing race reports at the beginning of
2024, but I did plan on posting a schedule of my upcoming events and
to continue writing in YLD. However, on March 27th, 2024, before doing
either, my&mdash;then ninety-one year old&mdash;mother had a stroke
that complicated both of our lives significantly.

As of Sunday, November 10th (i.e., the date I'm writing this), mom is doing
fairly well, considering.

Initially mom was in critical care, then in a regular hospital room
before being sent to in-patient rehab.  She got out of rehab on April
13th, but could no longer live alone. My sister, Marcia, lived with her until
June 3rd, when I moved in.  Marcia now stays with mom when I'm away.

Although mom has regained almost all her mobility and most of her
mentation, I've been overwhelmed and have let many things drop or be
postponed. I did, however, manage to participate in many running
events, including getting my needed Hardrock and Western States
Qualifier at the Bigfoot 200. I also kept my streaks alive: finishing
The Quad, Bataan Memorial Death March, Mt. Taylor, Javelina Jundred
and Deadman Peaks.
