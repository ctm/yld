# Black Friday Turkey Trots 2022

#### November 25th, 2022

This is a four mile race I actually run quickly, for better or
worse. It's held the day after Thanksgiving and&mdash;in
theory&mdash;by forcing myself to race it, I cultivate restraint in my
eating and drinking the day before.  In reality, for the last two
years I've done a challenging half marathon the day before and lacked
self-discipline the rest of the day.


Neither Ken Gordon nor James DuPlain were present, but there was a new
participant, Nick, who looked fast. Sure enough, I pulled away from everyone
except Nick, who casually asked

| Mind if I run with you?

I was happy to have the company, but I immediately knew that I was destined
for second place.

When I learned that Nick had moved to Albuquerque recently, I let him
know a bit about the local running scene.  We stayed together until
the turnaround. By that point, he had seen the entire course so I
encouraged him to run his pace, not mine, and off he went.

My official time was [30:27.6](357734), a bit slower than 2021
([28:50.7](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=261645&did=303089)).
My fastest was in 2018 ([28:20.2](https://www.webscorer.com/race?raceid=162436)).
