# Mt. Taylor 50k 2022

## Overview

This is an awesome race and no matter how much time I put into this
race report, I simply will not be able to do it justice.

One year they
had [Jim

and [Betsy
Kalmayer](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Betsy&lname=Kalmeyer)
running sweep and rather than boast about them, their presence wasn't
even mentioned.  Oh, and Betsy was ran sweep this year, too.

This year, the Mt. Taylor 50k was held on the first day of the
[Albuquerque International Balloon
Fiesta](https://balloonfiesta.com/).  That makes things tricky for me,
because I normally crew all nine days of fiesta.  In fact, I even help
the day before, so that hasn't left me much time to write a race report,
so for now this is just a placeholder.

I very much regret not writing up my Hardrock 100 experience, so I'm
hoping that by at least starting with this placeholder, I'll come back
and attempt to explain just why this is such an important race.  If
you read this stub and care, kick me in the nuts or light my pants on
fire and don't let my memory fail before writing _something_ down.
