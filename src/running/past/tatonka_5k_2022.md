# Tatonka 5k 2022

## Overview

Like Memorial Day, the [Tatonka
5k](https://www.core-crew.com/tatonka-5-10k-run) is both a somber
reflection of tragic loss as well as a celebration of life and
values. Billed as a Fun Run, it is an event put on by the brother and
mother of SFC Matthew Q. McClintock, RIP.

I managed to [not trip](https://www.strava.com/activities/8003156778)
and keep my heart rate up fairly high considering I didn't have any
extra pre-race caffeine.  My effort was sufficient to get me
[nineteenth
place](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=295185&did=352356).

## What the Ruck?

I chose to run the 5k wearing my backpack filled to the weight I train
with.  Specifically, when training on level ground I get the pack to
weigh at least forty pounds.  In this case it was forty-one point
eight pounds, because I didn't want to alter its contents after having
run a [leisurely training
run](https://www.strava.com/activities/7988067492) three days prior.

Last year I rode the Day of the Tread bicycle Century six days prior
to Javelina Jundred.  I had planned on doing the same this year, until
I saw that Forever Young, an Albuquerque Road Runners race that has
been held in April in the past, was going to be held on the same day as
Day of the Tread.  "Good! I can take Saturday off, run my guts out
at Forever Young and still beat myself up less than slowly riding DotT"
I thought to myself.

However, I learned about the Tatonka 5k when the results for the Feral
Hog 50k was posted.  It was an excellent cause and it was the day
before Forever Young, so I decided to do both.  Since I'll be doing
some serious rucking in 2023, I figured I could just slap my ruck on
and get some decent training effect.

## Pre Race

The race was scheduled to start at 10am which is something my body
isn't used to.  So, I got there a bit early just so I could try to
calm my GI tract.  While I was there, I ran into a familiar face from
the pre-covid Albuquerque Team RWB chapter.  Sadly, I couldn't
remember his name immediately, so I fessed up and asked.  "Don!" Of
course.

Don and I chatted a bit here and there, including what's been going on
in his life the last few years.  Somehow the Cocodona 250 came up and
I mentioned that because I had to do it without a crew or pacer, I wound
up running it very conservatively which meant I was sufficiently fresh
at the Mt. Elden aid station that I could drink a beer and have a shot
of Cinnamon Fireball.

## The Race

The race, like the annual Memorial Day service, was held in the [New
Mexico Veterans Memorial](https://nmvetsmemorial.org/). The course was
designed to allow the runners to see some of the key features of the
memorial, which was great, but it was a bit "squirrelly".  There were
several turns and the surface was a mix of asphalt, dirt, concrete and
even some grass.

I had to pay close attention not to trip and fall.  I do not like
falling when running with my pack, especially falling when I'm turning
a corner.  It's bad enough scraping my knees when falling forward, but
the one or two times when I've fallen while turning a corner, I've
jacked up my shoulders.  Luckily, those falls happen up in the Sandias
where there's nobody to see.  It's not that I'd be embarrassed to have
someone see me fall; I have no shame.  It's just that when I do fall
during races (e.g. during the [Big Cottonwood Marathon
2022](big_cottonwood_marathon_2022.html#bam)) it freaks people out and
mars _their_ race.

So, my primary goal was to not trip. My secondary goal was to run hard
and not take my foot off the gas.  I succeeded in both.  Yay!

## Post Race

Before Don finished, I had a celebratory beer, and started eating my
fortified oatmeal, and drinking my rice milk.  Then I congratulated
Don on finishing before sitting down and chatting with a few runners
I didn't know.

They collected people's bibs an then drew door prizes and Don won a
gigantic plastic candy cane filled with&mdash;what a strange
coincidence&mdash; shots of Cinnamon Fireball.  I don't take a lot of
selfies, but when I do, I'm often drinking.

> "Cheers!"

I ate couple handfuls of pretzels, watched the awards ceremony, then
left for an afternoon of doing things on "that side of town", which
included buying coffee, buying beer, drinking beer with my sister and
brother-in-law and visiting my mom.

Oh, and on my way back to my truck, before those errands and visits, I
cried a bit.

## Historical

Just in case the Tatonka 5k link goes stale, here's what it said:

Matthew's mother did some of the emceeing of the event and his
brother&mdash;who came up with the idea of a run to celebrate
Matthew's life&mdash;was out and about doing several things including
leading the way around the first lap.
