# Mt. Taylor Winter Quadrathlon

## Overview

I didn't "break"[^1] any bones or tear any ligaments.

Last year I [finished in slightly over seven
hours](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/84435/IndividualResult/SBTS?resultSetId=302356#U56959498),
but had a foot injury.  This year, I had a
different&mdash;lesser&mdash;foot injury (on a different foot), so I
figured I'd finish about a half hour earlier, and I did, in
[6:29:46.61](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/84435/IndividualResult/bHXk?resultSetId=366649#U70099043).

Fortunately for you, dear reader, I participated in the Albuquerque
Road Runners Relay RePlay
[FREE<i>for</i>ALL](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/fun-runs-freeforall.html)
event the following day, which meant I didn't write a ridiculously
long Quad report, at least not when I could still remember everything.

## Friday, i.e., check-in day

My son's car died in Moriarty. It's to be towed to a scrapyard in Albuquerque
and instead of driving to Grants early, I'm hanging back, in case he needs a
ride. Am I spending my time reviewing my drop bags, since I won't have extra
time to do so at the motel? Nope. I'm too busy frittering and wasting the
hours in an offhand way.

Uneventful drive. A line of people waiting to check-in to the motel, so I get
back in my truck and drive over to check-in at The Quad packet pickup and
gear drop. There's Ken. The good news is he's getting out and skiing a bunch.
The bad news is he's no longer running. That's very rough, but, as always,
he's upbeat.

### Dustin, Julie, Barry and Dan

In stroll Dustin and Julie.  I don't introduce them to Ken, because I'm
~~socially~~ inept.  Oh, and I also assume they know each other, because
they're all such great race directors and I imagine great race directors
communicate via telepathy.  I'll never know.

I think I ran into Barry then, too.  I certainly saw Barry before the
start of the race.  I ran into (and couldn't remember his name) Dan
Clark during gear drop-off, too.


## Saturday, i.e., race day

> Is it Tom?

> No. Mike.

> I do this every year, don't I?

> Yup.

Sure enough, I've parked in the same spot three years in a row and Michael
Mills has been right next to me.  He used to be (and perhaps still is) on
Albuquerque Mountain Rescue Council (AMRC), the Search-And-Rescue (SAR)
team that literally does the heavy lifting nearby.  I spent ten years as
a member of Cibola Search and Rescue and was on a few missions with Mike
back in the day, but still I got his name wrong&hellip;three years in a row.

A little while later, Leigh said hi.  She too was (and may still be)
on AMRC.

### Bike Up

Uneventful, but sufficiently long to give me a chance to appreciate the
fact that I hadn't ridden my bike since September and that even when I do
ride my bike, I studiously avoid riding uphill, because it sucks to do so
because I have no experience doing so.

### Run Up

I remembered to take my helmet off. I also took off my bike jersey. WTF?
Where is that shirt I "remembered" putting in my drop-bag?  I must have
put it in the other (bike -> run transition) drop bag.

I see Adam and he lets me know that he's not feeling it this year. At
the time, I didn't realize just how regularly he does this event. But
now, I've scraped the results from 2010 on and see that during that
time he's finished it ten times. Anyway, I cheer him on with Mitch
Hedberg's joke "I used to take drugs.  I still do, but I <i>used
to</i>."  There's a lot of truth in that little joke. I wouldn't have
been quite so cheery, were it not for the ibuprofen, acetaminophen and
caffeine dulling the discomfort of my right foot hot-spot.

### Ski Up

Nope. No shirt there, either.

Nobody took my poles, although to be fair, I've done The Quad more than
ten times and that only happened once.

This year, I finally learned how to put my boots on properly.  It's
not that I think you <i>can</i> teach an old dog new tricks; I think
even an old dog eventually gets tired of the massive discomfort
associated with putting his boots on incorrectly. Luckily, one of (I
have at least two) my friends whose nickname is KK, shared a YouTube
video that helped me greatly. I'd share it with you, but I can't find
it. It's not "Ski Boots - How to put them on" or even "How to Properly
Put on Your Ski Boots".  Oh well, you probably aren't even reading by
now and if you are, you probably know how to put your ski boots on.

### Snowshoe Up and Down

I drank a lot of beer on November 27th, 2022, when I turned sixty.  No,
I'm not going to claim that I was still drunk and that's why my snowshoe
time was so poor.  I'm actually pretty happy with my snowshoe time.  It's
just that on November 28th, I decided to not drink for a while and when
I got into Western States, I decided for a while means until June 25th,
which means&hellip; I did The Quad sober.

So, when I got to the edge of the universe and saw the shots lined up,
I promptly took one and poured it over my head.  I gave up (or at
least put on hold) <i>drinking</i> alcohol, but said nothing about
wearing it.  Good thing it wasn't cold up there, because I was still
shirtless and alcohol evaporates quicker than water, which leads to
increased evaporative cooling.

### Ski Down

Good thing that I had a fleece hat and Javelina Jundred arm-warmers,
because skiing down is a little chilly, since the little heaters in my
body idle when I'm not moving my legs.

If I ever want to get a decent time at this event, I'm going to have to
learn how to deal with the uphill portions of the ski down.  Watching
inch-worms speed past me is annoying.

### Run Down

I definitely had the runner's high going on.  I was listening to my
iPod library on random per-song shuffle.  I remember hearing [So You
Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll
Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAoTPXcPSg) followed by a song
that seemed sublime, but I was high.  I think it was something
discordant, like Captain Beefheart or The Residents, but I didn't
write it down and I certainly don't remember it weeks later. Oh well,
this paragraph is only filler.  How much can one say about an
uneventful five mile downhill run?

### Bike Down

There was a minor headwind, which my masculinity appreciates.  One
year we (meaning the mid-packers) had a tailwind on the bike down.
That was scary.  [According to
Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/8583846286/analysis), my max
speed this year was 43.8 miles per hour. It kills me to use the brake
on my bike in a race, and I didn't need to, but the year we had a
tailwind, I did.


### Dustin, Julie, Barry and Mike

Looking at the results, I see
that Dustin and Julie (both 5:45:18) came in less than two minutes
after Mike (5:43:19) and managed to pip Barry (5:45:23) by five
seconds.  Dang. That would have been cool to see, but I've never
finished The Quad that quickly and probably never will.

### Skiing shirtless was an accident.

#### I hadn't even planned on running shirtless.

I had intended to pack my purple JJ100 short-sleeve shirt in my
bike/run transition bag. However, with the distraction of Elvis's
issue, I wound up not packing a short-sleeve shirt in either of my
drop bags, but I thought I had.

I wound up getting to Grants later than I had planned and by the time
I got my bib, dropped off all my gear and checked in at the hotel, it
was [time to play poker](https://craftpoker.com/), so I did that
rather than review my gear. I didn't think I needed to review my gear
because this was my twelfth and each year I copy my gear list from the
previous year and only make a few changes based on weather.

So, on race day, when I got off my bike, I took off my long sleeve
shirt and was going to put my short sleeve shirt on, then I saw there
wasn't one. I could have just worn my short-sleeve bike jersey, but I
thought I must have accidentally put my short-sleeve shirt in my other
drop bag. I figured I could just run to the ski transition and put it
on there, but ... it wasn't there, either, nor was it in my snowshoe
backpack.

Although it was clearly one more instance of me mismanaging my time,
part of the problem is that about a week out I thought it was going to
be colder this year than last year, but it turned out to be
significantly warmer. I have four different pair of tights/leggings
and I only packed my heaviest ones. That was a mistake, so of course I
was overheated by the time I got off my bike.

# No Free Beer

After the race I was telling people that there was free beer, and since
I'm not drinking, they could have mine. Only there wasn't free beer.  I'm
pretty sure they've done that in the past, but I'm not sure they even had
it last year.  I can't remember, have I mentioned that my memory is bad?

[^1]: During The Quad in 2012, I fell hard while skiing and managed to
acquire several hairline fractures in the top of my humerus.  When I want
to be a drama boy, I can say I "broke" my shoulder, but come on; that's
not what people think of when they hear "break." Turns out, I also tore
one of my ligaments.  The hairline fractures were well on their way to
complete healing by the time I saw a doctor.
