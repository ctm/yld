# Resolutions Stink!

["Resolutions Stink!"](3281713308711524) is the
third stop on the [Burque Brew
Tour](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/burque-brewery-tour.html). This
year, however, I chose not to drink any alcohol from November 28th,
2022 (the day after I turned sixty) until June 25th, the day I assume
I'll finish [Western States](https://www.wser.org/). So, I raced and
socialized but didn't drink.

Pre-race I had a chance to chat with Gene Kersh, a runner I _mostly_ know
from seeing his name way before mine on various results pages.  He's a few
years older than I, so sometimes we're in the same age group, sometimes
he's in a more advanced group. Although I've seen Gene's results "forever,"
I only recently started chatting with him pre and post race.  Turns out
he's a fellow deadhead.  We are everywhere.

Similar to the [Black Friday Turkey Trots](../2022/black_friday.md)
and the [Grinch Lunch](../2022/grinch_lunch.md), Nick ("Piggy Style")
ran with ~~me~~ us initially, barely breaking a sweat while Gene and I
pushed fairly hard.  Yup, Gene was tagging along, or so I thought.
Turns out he was innit to winnit.  I did pull ahead of both of them
very briefly when running the downhills in the first half, but Gene
and Nick more than made up for it on the corresponding uphills. After
the turnaround I never caught up with them again, but I had a nice
view.

Once again, I knew I was beat and so I ran fast enough to remain in
third, but I didn't run _painfully_[^1] fast.  Nick pipped Gene at the end.

I had actually meant to bring my iPod touch and listen to my Speed 3
playlist.  If I had, I _suspect_ I'd have run a _little_ faster, but I
don't think I could have caught either.  Gene ran a [16:46
5k](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/140087/IndividualResult/bSdZ?resultSetId=362701#U42660677)
earlier this year.  That's a 5:24 pace for over three miles. I believe
my fastest mile ever was just barely under six minutes and that was years
ago when I was doing more speedwork.  I am not worthy.

The weather was excellent, so people gathered together outside to
relax and drink beer. I got to catch up a bit with several of the
[Albuquerque Road Runners](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/), including
meeting Doug, a runner who is older than I and younger than Gene.  I
also got to meet Gene's wife, Ellen.

My official time was [30:06.7](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=303794&did=366246).

### Epilogue

I had a great time at Resolutions Stink!, but I'm not sure that racing
four miles with a hot-spot that's probably Morton's neuroma the day
before my [hardest training run of the
year](https://www.strava.com/activities/8473162718) was a good idea.
OTOH, this cements my picture in the urban dictionary next to the
phrase "boy ain't right."

[^1]: the hot-spot I had on my right foot made itself known by the end
of the run, but it wasn't even uncomfortable; it was just barely
present.  The day after this race, I had a 24 mile training run with a 40 pound
pack.  Even with ibuprofen and acetaminophen my hot-spot screamed.
