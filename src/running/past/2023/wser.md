# Western States

This one will take a little bit of yak shaving to write up.  In the meantime,
here are some notes to myself.

* 2015
  * Signing up for the Grand Slam
  * The SAR mission where I injured my foot
  * "Run the first 33 miles with a limp" strategy
  * Leading Gunhild Swanson off course
  * DNF

* 2023
  * Pre-race
    * Meeting Jim (James Keller) and Emily in Reno
    * Peter Livingstone, my right-hand man (crew & pacer)
    * No overnight parking citation
    * Young Dirty Rob (or Robb -- I don't remember)
    * Pre-race meeting Matt (Hagen), Ian (???) and Marty (Gardner)
    * Cardiovascular Survey
  * Race
    * Chatting with Matt, but not recognizing him
    * Chatting with Ken Ward
    * Falling a couple of times on the snow
    * Four hours (IIRC) before taking another ibuprofen (I *think* I took
      one before the start)
    * 200mg ibuprofen every hour and a half
    * 500mg acetaminophen every three hours
    * Pete was my crew until he was my pacer
    * Foot mostly held up (albeit with analgesics) to around mile 70
    * I didn't know the end of the course very well
    * speed vs. foot discomfort balance
    * stacked a little early after Green Gate
    * stopped analgesics when confident that I'd finish with a big buffer
    * slowed to a crawl at the end (due to discomfort)
    * mini sprint at end (but not across the line; too gassed)
  * Post Race
    * food line too long for my right foot
    * slept
    * forgot about cardiovascular survey
    * Ate a jar of jalapeno stuffed olives
