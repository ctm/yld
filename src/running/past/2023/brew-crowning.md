# Burque Brew Tour Crowning

The [Burque Brew Tour
Crowning](https://www.facebook.com/events/1307112846691234) is social event
with a little race prepended so the guests have something to do before the
bar opens.

Ostensibly, the king and queen of the Burque Brew Tour are crowned for
garnering the most points for their sex in the four previous BBT
races: the [Black Friday Turkey Trots](../2022/black_friday.md),
[Grinch Lunch](../2022/grinch_lunch.md), [Resolutions
Stink!](resolutions-stink.md) and [V-Day](v-day.md).  This year, the king's
head was too big for a crown, so instead the winners were adorned with
visibility Xinglets.

I chose to run to the event, run the event and run back. Although I
live only 7.7 miles away, I [chose an 18.8 mile](academy-of-pain.md)
route down.  Additionally, I chose to abstain from three things that I
normally do when I'm racing at this distance

1. drink espresso timed to maximally contribute to my pace
2. bring water to cool me down
3. listen to my [Speed 3 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiHB06ix3lYik1aF8qZpFQN3A1QAtzTFu)

However, after Perky fired the shotgun and we were off, it looked like
I might be able to win a free beer for the Muirheads if I ran a little
faster than I would have preferred.

This was new ground for me.  I hadn't run eighteen miles to get to the
start of a race before, although I do plan on doing the Boston Marathon
Double someday.  That's when you start at the finish line and
unofficially run to the start line, then officially run the Boston
Marathon.  If anyone drops a wheelbarrow of cash on me, I'll do it
this year, but that seems unlikely.

I've also never raced in the middle of a timed event where I have my
heart set on cranking out an easy fifty miles. I'm pretty darned sure
that if I ran _too quickly_ I'd stress my legs too much and the
remaining 27.4 miles I needed to finish post-race would be annoying
and I'm a big baby[^1].  What I didn't know was what would be too
quickly in this context.

Luckily, I didn't find out. I ran quickly enough to [win a free
beer](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=309537&did=376999&gender=M)
for Glenda, but slowly enough that the rest of my day was skittles.

Normally, I include Strava tracks for each of my races, but my [Academy of
Pain Strava Tracks](https://www.strava.com/activities/8777534313)
subsume my Crowning Race. Look around mile 20.  In theory, I averaged
about an 8:10 pace (minutes per mile).

Whee!
