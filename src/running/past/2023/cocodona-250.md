# Cocodona 250

Cocodona 250 is an epic race and I will try to write an epic race report.
In the meantime, I finished in [114:19:53](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=95982#id220546), which was a little less than ten hours before
the final cutoff, not too different from last year.

I'm pretty sure that if the race were scored by how many different venomous
animals one saw, especially if the strength of the venom were taken into
account, I would have won, as I document in my "[creepy crawly race report](cocodona-250/creepy-crawly.md)".

  <summary>Some sadness you may want to skip</summary>
  
  An artist's vocabulary includes myriad words for specific
  combinations of color, hue, shade, etc. A wordsmith's vocabulary
  includes myriad words for &hellip; well &hellip; everything. I'm
  neither and am simply abusing "beauty."
  
  The course is beautiful. The sky is beautiful. The scenery is beautiful,
  even the venomous creatures are beauty.  There can be beauty in sadness.
  
  Last year, a friend of mine, who had lived both in New Mexico and Arizona
  was following my progress and exchanging texts.  In theory she was dying
  of cancer.  In fact, _in theory_ she was already dead, because she was
  diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer and given a couple weeks to live
  and by now it was a couple months.

  > she: Still at Munds Park? Should I be worried? Tracker not updating?
  
  > me: I’m 20 miles in or more. I’ll report my tracker now. Thanks!

  > she: Been practicing my Italian and Dutch. I find if I’m just barely nodding off, stuff goes into my brain better!

  AFAICT, anyone who has completed an event like the Cocodona 250 finishes
  in a happy mix of ecstatic satisfaction and delusion.  _I_ can do anything.
  **Anything** is possible.  She's studying her Italian and Dutch. She's
  not said a thing about her condition. She's unique. Maybe she beat it.
  
  If she had beaten it, this text wouldn't be hidden behind a gate.
  She died three weeks later.
  
  FWIW, if she had lived, my creepy crawler report would be behind a gate,
  because she was bitten by a snake as a child and everyone who knew her
  avoided the subject in her presence or used the word "string" as a
  substitute for "snake" at her request.
  
  Is it a remarkable coincidence that I saw all those critters that
  would have worried her on this event as the anniversary of her death
  approaches, or was it [something
  else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z55Tf7M1tzQ)?
