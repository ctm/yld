# Cocodona 250

Cocodona 250 is an epic race and I will try to write an epic race report.
In the meantime, I finished in [114:19:53](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=95982#id220546), which was a little less than ten hours before
the final cutoff, not too different from last year.

I'm pretty sure that if the race were scored by how many different venomous
animals one saw, especially if the strength of the venom were taken into
account, I would have won, as I document in my "[creepy crawly race report](cocodona-250/creepy-crawly.md)".
