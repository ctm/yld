## Overview

I made six ascents, which put me at 29th out of 31 participants, but I
beat all the people who stayed home. Oh wait, since there was a limit
to the number of entrants, my presence kept someone at home[^1].

## Winners

We were all winners, because Julie and Dustin put on great races.
However, my pen-pal [Guillermo
Canedo](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Guillermo&lname=Canedo&age=53)
did 26 ascents for 13,000 official feet of gain (but [his Strava says
14,209]((https://www.strava.com/activities/8699190542))). 2022's Feral
Hog 50k winner [Adam
Drozek](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Adam&lname=Drozek&age=34)
did 21, pipping all the lazybones who only did 20.  Anyone who did 20
or more ascents got this super cool fake rock.  That led to a seven
way tie for third place.

Labe Kopelov, from Bedford Indiana, was one of the third-placers.  He
deserves a special mention, because he's sixty-nine years young.  However,
he doesn't win the furthest traveled (at least according to UltraSignup's
City field), since Kevin Stewart is ostensibly from Carmel Maine.

[^1]: Just kidding.  I explained my predicament to the race directors
and made sure that I was the last person on the wait-list, precisely
because I <em>didn't</em> want to tie up a slot.
