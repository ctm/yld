# Foothills Fat Ass
## Overview
Perky and Prince Charming came up with the idea of a [New Year's Day
Fat Ass Run](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/foothills-50k/) and
implemented it on 2012.  They were so successful that they were
~~cursed~~ blessed to host it &hellip; forever (or through 2022,
whichever came first).  If you've ever watched [Victor Wooten play
Amazing Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA-ZKDOoBnk), you may
have decided to give up on playing the bass.  He's that good.

And so the Foothills Fat Ass was never to be hosted again, except,
well although it's inconceivably intimidating to try to fill their
shoes, I do have [big
feet](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/trail-white-horse/)[^1],
and "not too smart" would be my middle name, except it's three
words. Additionally, I have plenty of free time, **since I'm not wasting
any by trying to learn how to play the bass**. So&hellip;

I kept the tradition alive by hosting it this year.  I also ran "sweep".

## As Race Director
### What Worked

Three and a half awesome volunteers: Jason Romero, Mark Werkmeister,
Roleen Younis and my wife.  They did all the hard work.  Jason and
Mark manned the aid station. Roleen womanned the 50k start/finish.  My
wife, Sophia, made the black-eyed pea salsa that is guaranteed to
bring people good luck (not necessariy the people who ate it or even
attended, but somewhere, _somebody_ will have good luck in 2023, at
least momentarily). She gets full marks for her cooking, but she was
dragooned.

Much of the aid station food and beverages worked, and I've been keeping
track, although via poory indexed email, so I'll elaborate later.

The starting time of 8am was perfect, except for the tardy couple.

The participants worked.  They showed up and feigned happiness and cheer.

Using the Matthews house worked in that it was better than nothing.

### What Didn't Work

Hiring an ambulance to stay just out of sight of the house, in case someone
got injured playing air-hockey was overkill.  I won't do that again.

Having two separate start times and locations short-changed the shorter
distance participants.

Using the Matthews house forced the 50k participants to run on roads
for about a third of the course.  It also meant that there was no food
or beverages awaiting the finishers of the shorter distances.

I may have been the only one to eat the pecan pie.

The open course for the 50k didn't work, since one of the 50k participants
wound up not running the southern most loop.

### Plans for Next Year

have begun.

We're investigating moving the start and finish area to a location
closer to the foothills.

We'll come up with a better way of keeping people informed about the
race.  One possibility is using Facebook.  That would be better than
only updating the web page.  There are other alternatives though.

If we have a better way of communicating with the participants, having an
open unmarked course might work.  Not marking the course has several
advantages, including no setup or teardown time and not having to worry
about people removing (or relocating) the markings.

We'll line up volunteers much earlier, and encourage the volunteers from
2023 to revert to being participants in 2024.

## As Entrant
### What Worked
I didn't get lost.

Although I stumbled many times, both my knees and both my hands never touched
the ground.

The cactus spines didn't poke far enough into my shoes to pierce my feet.

Jolly Rancher hard candies.

### What Didn't Work

Too much time chatting with the aid station volunteers [cost
me my seven hour goal](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=301303&did=361843).

### Plans for Next Year

To finish under seven hours, duh!
