# V Day

[V Day Run](https://www.facebook.com/events/5573661939381690) is the fourth
run of the Burque Brewery Tour.

Overcast, not particularly windy. Warm for me. The course was new, but
I had been to the [Hops Brewery](https://www.hopsbrewery.com/) once
before after a (pre-covid) [Team RWB])https://about.teamrwb.org/)
event.

My big concern was my foot.

The day before I had used my wife's X-Acto knife to attempt to remove
what appeared to be some sort of splinter.  I think I got something
out, but my eyes are poor enough that I'll never know.  Yes, my foot
bled a little.  No, I didn't need stitches.  It did leave my foot a
little sorer, but I knew that the following day I'd have the V Day
race and would get a chance to see what the foot would feel like.

FWIW, I've spent more time&mdash;a _lot_ more&mdash;thinking how to
describe my foot situation in this race report than I did on my little
extraction, and that's even when you count washing the blade before,
and especially after.

I ran fine. My official time was
[23:08](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=306559&did=371483).

More later.
