# Duke City Marathon 2023

## Overview

My first twenty six
[miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/10086484966) were much more
consistent than [last
year](https://www.strava.com/activities/7974024108), **but** they were
consistently slow due to the apparent extra mileage that my watch had
at the end.  So, my final time was
[5:00:37](https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1063165/Course/2408972/Bib/1923)
and that's with me running the last .44 miles at an 8:57 min/mile
pace. Prior to that, my fastest mile was 11:02 and my slowest was
11:46.

### Failure

I believe I was _probably_ a net asset as a pacer this year, but only because,
as far as I know, nobody was actually using me to break five hours, but I could
be wrong about that.

Thirty seven seconds may not seem like much, but it's unacceptable as is, _and_
that was after me speeding up at the end. If I had run my last .43 miles at
the 11:22 minute per mile pace that I had averaged (assuming the mileage from
my GPS watch was correct), I would have been 100 seconds over my 5:00:00.00
goal.

### More Later&hellip;

It was a fine event and I enjoyed talking with the people around me, many of
whom were doing DCM as their New Mexico marathon for the [Fifty States Marathon
Club](http://www.50statesmarathonclub.com/). I did not, however, take
notes and I had to scramble a bit in the days after DCM to get ready for
the Javelina Jundred. So, when (if?) I go back to write up more, I'll
fail at that, too.
