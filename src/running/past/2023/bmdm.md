# Bataan Memorial Death March

## Preview

This one is going to be tough to write.

Since I've been writing race reports for less than a year, many of my
race reports describe the race itself as well as my participation
within it.  I have a tough time writing about the Bataan Memorial
Death March, because it involves recounting various stories of the
Bataan Death March and its survivors as well as the people who didn't
survive.

As far as I know, [Valdemar De
Herrera](https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2023/03/19/4791797a/original.jpg)
was the only survivor of the Bataan Death March to make it out to the
Memorial this year.  He was seated at the front row in the "Survivors
and Descendants" presentation, but did not directly address the
attendees. Valdemar is 103.

In 2019, the last time the Bataan Memorial Death March was held in
person, [Ben
Skardon](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/gen-ben-skardon-bataan-death-march-survivor-and-famed-clemson-grad-passes-away-at-104/)
(RIP) and [James
Bollich](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/survivor-of-the-bataan-death-march-101-year-old-lafayette-man-relishes-his-time-spent/article_c56278a8-1c06-11ed-9ab4-13db655e07af.html)
each gave a presentation and answered questions. I believe James is
still alive, even though he didn't make it to BMDM this year.  Beyond
him and Valdemar, it's unclear how many other survivors are still
alive.

I've already created a [nascent Bataan section](../../../bataan.md) that
briefly mentions both the Death March and the Memorial.

I haven't yet decided how to frame my race report for this event, so for now
I'll just state that I am very glad it was held in person this year.

I understand the reason for the three year hiatus and I'm sure that's
what caused the number of attendants to be about half of the number
in 2019.  However, I think the organizers did a top notch job with
everything except the web-site (which lacked basic information, like
the schedule for Saturday).  As such, I suspect that next year's event
will be larger and for the spirit of service will resume its growth.

## Spoiler

My twin daughters both completed the full distance. Margaret, an Army
cadet at UNM, was part of a five person light ROTC team. Iris,
Commanding Officer of La Cueva's JROTC company&mdash;still a civilian
for a few more months&mdash;finished as an individual, also in the
light division.  I am crazy proud of them.
