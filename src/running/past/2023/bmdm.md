# Bataan Memorial Death March

I've already created a [nascent Bataan section](../../../bataan.md) that
briefly mentions both the Death March and the Memorial.

## Event, March, Race

This "race report" is a bit convoluted due to the Bataan Memorial
Death March being a two day event, even though that wasn't obvious
from the web site this year.

Saturday is a day of learning, Sunday a day of doing.

Historically, there were many educational activities to participate in
on Saturday, however the most powerful was when the veterans of the
Bataan Death March would speak and answer questions. Sunday is a march
for most, but a race for some[^1].

### Saturday

Prior to 2023, the last time the Bataan Memorial Death March was held
was 2019 and by then although there were other Bataan Death March
veterans present, only two actually gave presentations and answered
questions: [Ben
Skardon](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/gen-ben-skardon-bataan-death-march-survivor-and-famed-clemson-grad-passes-away-at-104/)
(RIP) and [James
Bollich](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/survivor-of-the-bataan-death-march-101-year-old-lafayette-man-relishes-his-time-spent/article_c56278a8-1c06-11ed-9ab4-13db655e07af.html).

As far as I know, [Valdemar De
Herrera](https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2023/03/19/4791797a/original.jpg)
was the only survivor of the Bataan Death March to make it out to the
Memorial this year.  He was seated at the front row in the "Survivors
and Descendants" presentation, but did not directly address the
attendees. Valdemar is 103.

Although he didn't make it to BMDM this year, I believe James Bollich
is still alive. Beyond him and Valdemar, it's unclear how many other
survivors are still alive.

There were three speakers at the "Survivors and Descendants": Margaret
Garcia, author of [Tell Me Another War Story: The Life of Evans Garcia
Courageous Soldier, American Hero, My
Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30055478-tell-me-another-war-story),
Alan Overmier, son of [Bill
Overmier](https://www.stripes.com/veterans/2021-08-20/new-mexico-wwii-veteran-pow-camp-survivor-dies-101-2612408.html)
and a third person whose name I can't recall. Margaret and Alan briefly told
stories of their fathers.

Although she didn't tell it in this presentation, Margaret's story of
how her father and his fellow POW accomplices killed and cooked a crow
is a story that my (now adult) children remember from previous
presentations.  They substituted the cooked crow for some exotic
game-bird delicacy that they were supposed to prepare for their
Japanese guards. Although in hell, they ate like kings that one night.

Alan is a fellow Albuquerque Road Runner.  His dad, Bill, was captured
on Corregidor.  As such, Bill didn't have to make the Death March.
However, although the Death March itself was gruesome, the prisoner of
war camps, hell ships and forced labor camps that followed were much
longer and far deadlier events.  That's one of the things people who
attend the talks learn on Saturdays.

The third presentation was about other memorials, mostly throughout New
Mexico to the aftermath of the war in the Philippines.

Before the descendants presentation began, we (my brother-in-law Jeff,
my daughter Iris,and I) chatted with some [Team RWB
members](https://teamrwb.org/).  Team RWB always has a big presence at
BMDM and although many have been going to BMDM for years, it was a
first for some.

### Sunday

#### Pre-March

There were only three of us at the Motel-6 Telshor: Jeff, Iris and
myself.  Still, we chose to go in two vehicles, my wife's van and
Jeff's parents' car.

Jeff and I got up at 3:20[^2] so we could be driving by 3:50.  We were
told to be at the gates by 4:30 and even though we didn't get on the
highway quite as smoothly as I had anticipated (I had forgotten that
everyone would be tired and that we hadn't done this in four years),
that's where we were, going through the gates at 4:30.

We hung out in our vehicles a while, but left before too long to hike
to the start line (technically, to the porta potties that were only at
the start line, none in or near the parking area).  We had a buffer so
that things could go wrong and we'd still get to the start on time, but
I chewed up that buffer by forgetting my handhelds and then losing my
car keys.

So, after doing some backtracking and further backtracking we finally
made it to the porta potty line.  We had enough time to make one visit,
then head out to the street where the participants were lined up.

I haven't yet decided how to frame my race report for this event, so for now
I'll just state that I am very glad it was held in person this year.

#### The March

I [raced and lost](bmdm/my-race.md). Jeff had been plagued with
cluster headaches in the weeks leading up to BMDM and had been talking
about turning left at around mile eight and only doing the fifteen
mile Honorary March, but of course he did the full distance.

My twin daughters both completed the full distance. Margaret, an Army
cadet at UNM, was part of a five person light ROTC team. Iris,
Commanding Officer of La Cueva's JROTC company&mdash;still a civilian
for a few more months&mdash;finished as an individual, also in the
light division.  I am crazy proud of them, and of Jeff and and of my
sister Marcia who stayed home this year.

#### Post March

After crossing the finish line, my pack weighed 37.5 pounds. The
majority of the weight was food, although I had some warm clothing
that I took to wear at the start and the pack itself weighs a few
pounds. I donated the food (mostly rice, although I think I also had a
bag of beans) to the food bank and headed over to the free lunch.

The free lunch is a nice social event.  I started at a table of people
I didn't know and chatted with the finishers.  They had been doing the
event for several years and were glad that it was being held in person
again.  I then noticed Gerry and Christine, a couple of Team RWB
Albuquerque friends and joined them.

I had a chance to talk
[Zachary](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2023/115251/1771),
the gentleman who beat me.  I also had a chance to talk to the person
who crushed my spirit.  Turns out he didn't have a plate in his
backpack, so he wasn't competing in the heavy division.  Oops. That'll
learn me.

The free lunch comes with a free beer for people old enough. Although
I wasn't drinking alcohol that day, I put it in my now almost empty
pack, then ran into George and Nora. George had completed the heavy
division carrying sixty one pounds and change. We hung out for a
while, then they needed to move on, so in a show of solidarity, I
donned his ruck to cement in my mind that I'm not worthy. I am,
however, stubborn.

After leaving George and Nora (and George's ruck!), I headed [backward
on course from the finish
line](https://www.strava.com/activities/8743870329), looking for to
welcome the other finishers I know.  Cowbell guy was out there, so I
stopped and got a picture or two with him.  I don't remember the exact
order of whom I met, but Roleen, Demetria and Lisa were there and a few
others. Then came Uncle Jeff.

> Want a beer?

> Sure!

I hadn't thought all the camera people out there, but sure enough
UJ's photo has him crossing the finish line with a craft beer in
his hand.  Sweet.

Next it was out to greet Iris. By then I had taken my shirt off and
put it in my pack. My pack has a small metal rod that causes it to keep
its shape even when it is almost entirely empty.  So sure enough,
Iris's photo has her being chased by shirtless me, with a finisher's
medal around my neck and what appears to be a full large pack.  Whee!

Not too long after that, Iris and I went to find Margaret.  All the
members of a team have to cross the finish line within five seconds
of each other, so the team moves no faster than the slowest person.
That can be frustrating, but Margaret was happy.  Yay!

After more socializing at the free lunch, Jeff, Iris and I started
walking to our car.  It wasn't that far away.  Oops. It _was_ [that
far away](https://www.strava.com/activities/8744013160).  Iris and I
plopped down the second Jeff offered to run ahead and pick up the car
and get us.

Iris was a hurting unit. This was the first time she had put a marathon
distance on her feet.  Margaret had previously "run" the Deadman Peaks
Trail Marathon, which is actually a tougher course than the BMDM course,
so she knew what to expect.  Furthermore, since Margaret finished the
day with her ROTC group, I couldn't really tell just how beat up she
was. Iris, on the other hand, was whipped.  I was sure that tomorrow
was going to be worse.

### Monday

"Tomorrow" (i.e., the Monday after the March), Jeff and I let Iris
sleep in while we headed out to [Milagro Coffee Y
Espresso](https://www.yelp.com/biz/milagro-coffee-y-espresso-las-cruces).
Their web site might not be up, and Bernie sold the place, but it's
still one of my favorite coffee shops in the world.  This was our
second or third visit on this trip and once again, Uncle Jeff paid.

Turns out, I was wrong. Iris felt _much_ better after a night's sleep
and was disappointed, but understanding, that we hadn't woken her and
taken her with us to Milagro.

I drove us back to Albuquerque and tried not to bug her too much.

### The Future

I understand the reason for the three year hiatus and I'm sure that's
what caused the number of attendants to be about half of the number
in 2019.  However, I think the organizers did a top notch job with
everything except the web-site (which lacked basic information, like
the schedule for Saturday).  As such, I suspect that next year's event
will be larger and for the spirit of service will resume its growth.

I'll be back. Iris will be at USMA. Margaret may go heavy. I suspect
Jeff will run the full in 2024 and with luck, Marcia will join us.
My guess is 90% of the other people I've mentioned by name will be
there too.

If you go, say hi. Maybe I won't wait five weeks to write up my 2024
report and I'll mention you, too.

[^1]: From an outsider's perspective, the whole concept of a "Memorial Death
March" may seem disrespectful. It's not. Similarly,
racing&mdash;rather than marching&mdash;is also not disrespectful.

[^2]: Iris had her own room, so I don't know what time she got up.  I'm very
proud of her. The day before she asked what time she needed to be in the
lobby. I told her 3:50 and we both knew that she'd be there then. Yay!
