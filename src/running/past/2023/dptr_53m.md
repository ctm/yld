# Deadman Peaks 53 Miler 2023

## Overview

Results aren't up yet, but my Strava activity claims I finished in
[14:44:27](https://www.strava.com/activities/10165600641).  I deliberately
ran slowly because I was concerned about my right foot.  

### Experiment in white

I chose to wear the same white shirt and white arm bands during the portion
of the race with the most sun exposure.  There was ice at the second aid station
which helped, but unfortunately none at the turnaround. Overall I think it
helped, but it's hard to say because I was deliberately running slowly.

### A couple of awesome first fifty milers

I wound up catching up to Carlos, a runner from Los Alamos that I
hadn't previously met. We wound up chatting for quite a bit. It was
his first fifty miler and he was getting it done. Yay!

In the final segment I caught up with Candace, a Navajo runner and she
too was running her first fifty miler. I hung out with her as she made
the final big climb and she did it faster than I probably would have had
I not had such excellent company.

### My right foot

Surprisingly, my right foot held up exceedingly well.  I did three new
things that may have helped:
1. I trimmed the custom orthotic that I wear in my right shoe
2. I wore Smartwool socks instead of my usual Balega or Drymax socks
3. I wore my final pair of Olympus 4 instead of one of my Olympus 5 pairs

I can't untrim the orthotic, so that change is permanent whether it
helped or not. I will wear an Olympus 5 pair for the [White Mesa Fat
Ass 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/white_mesa_50k/) but
still use the Smartwool socks.  Then, I'll use the result of that
experiment to decide what to wear for [Socorro Souls of
Sorrow](https://www.socorrotrailrunningseries.com/socorrosoulsofsorrow). So,
two weeks from now I'll probably have more insight into what's causing
the trouble than I've had in the previous eleven months.

### More later&hellip;
Maybe. I'm still pretty behind in everything.
