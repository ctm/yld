# Javelina Jundred 2023

## Overview

Javelina Jundred was my first 100 miler, back in 2012.  My dad and
Jeanne, his wife, lived in nearby Gold Canyon, so I visited with them
before and after the race.  They even came out to see me "run". I
wound up coming back, year after year after year.  In 2020, my dad
died, but Jeanne continued to live there, so I continued visiting her,
until this year. Earlier in the year Jeanne moved to Chicago so she
could be near her great granddaughter.

It was strange not seeing Jeanne this year, but I did see many of my
running friends, including my two Hardrock 2021 pacers: [Peter
Livingstone](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Peter&lname=Livingstone)
and [Mark
Werkmeister](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Mark&lname=Werkmeister).
I listed Peter first, because he got the easier job of pacing me first
at Hardrock. Mark paced cleanup, and it was messy.  For JJ100M 2023, I
saw Mark first, because he graciously picked me up Friday at my house
on his drive down from Santa Fe and dropped me back home on Monday.

I finished in
[23:07:10](https://www.strava.com/activities/10124793718) which was
[first in my age
group](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=99186#id220546)
(male 60-69).  Nobody my age or older beat me.

## My right foot

Considering how badly my right foot hurt at the end of Western States,
I went into JJ100M with some trepidation and a lot of analgesics at
hand.  Unlike WSER, the analgesics were sufficient to allow me to run
w/o discomfort, but I did choose to go slower than I might have had I
not worried about my foot.

## More Later&hellip;

I am still crazy behind in everything, so I haven't had a chance to write
up this race yet. I did, however, take a few notes, so it is likely that
I'll write a real race report someday.
