# Berta Fun Run

## Background

This was the final event in the >>Albuquerque Road Runners
[Free<i>for</i>All
series](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/fun-runs-freeforall.html).  I
accidentally missed the first event due to forgetting to put it on my
calendar.  I ran with John Farrow as a partner in Relay RePlay, the
second event.  I chose not to run the third event, Pi(e) Day. It was
on a Tuesday evening and I couldn't get myself out the door.

This is the fifteenth Berta Run. The run is named after the street
that KK, the hostess lives on.  Each year the course is a bit different, but
it's in Edgewood NM, so most of the course is going to be about 7,000
feet above sea level and **there will be hills**.

## Race Day

Other than a few usual suspects, I didn't really know who all would
attend.  I was happy to see my friend Spencer there.  He had to cancel
out of [Shenanigains](shenanigains.md) at the last minute, so it's been
a while since I saw him.  Turns out, he kept me honest and I, he.

Since this is a Road Runner event, I wore my ARR crop-top pre-run, but
took it off for the race itself.  Yay! I remembered something.  It
wasn't until after we were running that I realized that I had
forgotten to take my pre-race double espresso.  Oh well.

Spencer and I took the lead within the first mile. He's light on his
feet and would get ahead of me on the uphills, then I'd pass him on
the downhills.  Uh oh. This is going to be an actual _race_, where if
I push myself fairly hard I have a chance of winning, but if I don't,
it'll be another second.

Although the course was explained to me, and I had a map, I wanted to
turn where the course didn't go and then almost missed a turn.
Luckily, Spencer let me know when I was about to go off course.  I
also wasn't completely sure where all the hills would be, nor the
total distance of the course, so when it looked like I was on the
final downhill, I cranked up my pace until my HR was at around 160 and
did seven tenths of a mile in 4:18, a 6:09 pace.  I did not want
Spencer catching me in the final stretch (which turned out to be a .3
mile uphill).

According to my GPS watch, there was 541 feet of gain, I averaged an
8:22 min/mile pace, with an average heart rate of 146 bpm, with my
best mile being 7:03.  [Strava's
numbers](https://www.strava.com/activities/8814457349) are similar.

## [Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly7PONiKGUs)

The post race spread was glorious, most of which was homemade by KK,
although Perky and Prince Charming brought a vegan cherry pie. I did
not take notes on what I ate, nor did I take photos (I should have!),
so this list of what I ate (all vegan) is incomplete: tomato and
veggie casserole, bean stew, slice of cherry pie, overnight oats with
tiramisu-like topping, chips and salsa, grapes, mixed nuts and gummy
candy.  There was also beer and mimosas, but it's not June 25th yet.
There was also plenty of non-vegan food, apple juice, coffee, etc.
