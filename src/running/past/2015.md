# 2015

In 2015 I:
* finished first in the Bataan Memorial Death March Male Civilian Heavy Division[^1]
* was registered for the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning, but
  * [Did not finish](2015/wser.md) the first race of the Grand Slam, Western States
  * Barely finished the [Vermont 100](https://ultrarunning.com/calendar/event/vermont/race/12574/results)
  * Did not finish the Leadville Trail 100
  * Barely finished the [Wasatch 100](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=34364#id220546)
* finished the Deadman Peaks Trail Run [DFL](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=31870#id220546)[^2] (53 miler)
* finished the [Duke City Marathon](https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/uwb2wkmsrrwem3qf/detail/3k3mb5ktb9kjns95) the day after
* finished my fourth consecutive [Javelina Jundred](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=31274#id220546)

Although I was lucky to do well at the Bataan Memorial Death March, the only
reason I created a 2015 page is have a place to hang my embarrassing [Western
States DNF](2015/wser.md).

[^1]: You'll have to take my word for this, because division-specific
results for BMDM are not available on the net.  Its Your Race took
over the timing for this event in 2016 and the BMDM web-site was
redone, with previous years' results getting lost in the
shuffle. Marathon Guide has [2015
results](https://www.marathonguide.com/races/run/bataan-memorial-death-march-15/2015/results/),
but they intersperse light (no ruck) and heavy (35 pound or more ruck)
division results.  2015 was a soft year. My time of 5:10:35 would not take
first in male civilian heavy ever again.

[^2]: I deliberately ran DPTR50M slowly atbecause I was very nervous about
the Duke City Marathon the following day. I just wanted to complete them both
with minimal discomfort.
