Origins:
My first was in 2016, on April 1st, no less
I do not know if it had been held previously

Has my wife and three kids (14, 11) listed as having done a lap, but I know they
weren't drinking.  Surprisingly, there was frost on the tents


In 2023 it conflicted with Balloon Fiesta, having been held on October 13th,
so I couldn't attend.
