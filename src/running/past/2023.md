# 2023

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Bataan Memorial Death March
2. Hardrock (or qualifier)
3. Fun Around

I'm currently in my [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.  If finances permit, I'll also race the Tough Ruck on April
16th, 2023.

My next block leads up to Hardrock (the next time I get in) or a
qualifier or two in the years I don't get in. This year, I did not get
in to Hardrock, although I did get in to Western States.  So the
Bigfoot 200[^1] will be my Hardrock Qualifier, and I won't be attempting
the Grand Slam.  After Bigfoot, I'm back to a "fun around" block.

My "fun around" block ends in mid November.  During this block I
"participate" (i.e., try to finish) in a lot of events, but actually
"race" (i.e., try to _win_ or at least run quickly for my age) in very
few.

## Events I'd Like to Enter

Here's what I have run in 2023 and what I'd like to run in the
remainder of the year.  My participation in the Tough Ruck and
Cocodona 250 is predicated on me successfully financing
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com), which looks promising, but
is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's shareholders are my
highest priority. However, my running and rucking seem to help me at
work.

I currently plan to race Javelina Jundred, in that I'd like to try for
a finish in under twenty hours.  I've started 2023 in a semi injured
state, so that seems overly ambitious, but historically I've healed
well, so that's still my plan.  JJ100 is still a long way away.
Besides, if I make _all_ my goals, I'm not setting them high enough.

Although I've included the Tucson Marathon in my 2023 plans, my
running it in 2022 adversely affected my training for the Bataan
Memorial Death March, but there were complicating factors (Jeanne's
surgery, my right foot's hot-spot).  In principle, I like qualifying
for Boston early, but of all the events on the list the Tucson
Marathon that will require extended scrutiny as it gets closer.

The `R` column is only checked when I plan to run very hard (e.g., to win
or to try to do well for my age).  Racing is hard and annoying and lazy
is my middle name.
