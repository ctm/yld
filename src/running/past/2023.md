# 2023

On Saturday, December 23rd, I raced the [Grinch
Lunch](https://www.facebook.com/events/712962300691876/) as my last
event of the year.  I have yet to convert this page from "what I plan
to do in 2023" to "what I did in 2023", nor have I created my 2024
calendar, but I'll do that eventually (_maybe_).

As of Sunday, December 24th, Strava shows I've run 2,387.6 miles in
561 hours fifty-one minutes, climbing 252,028 feet.  If I remember,
I'll update those numbers before the new year ticks over.

Financially, 2023 was a tough year, and that translated into me having
much less time to write race reports, so although I completed almost
everything I had planned for the year, I wrote up very little of it.

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Bataan Memorial Death March
2. Hardrock (or qualifier)
3. Fun Around[^4]

During my [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM) I have relatively few events.  I do
my ruck training two and a half days a week. I had planned on
trying to participate in the Tough Ruck in 2023, but I nursed a
hot-spot in my right foot during my BMDM training and chose
to aim for Tough Ruck 2024 instead.

On March 19th, I [finished the Bataan Memorial Death March](2023/bmdm.md).

My next block leads up to Hardrock (the next time I get in) or a
qualifier or two in the years I don't get in. This year, I did not get
in to Hardrock, although I did get in to Western States.  I
had won the Bigfoot 200 lottery, but had to defer to 2024 since it
conflicted with [Acceptance
Day](https://www.westpoint.edu/parents/frequently-asked-questions#marchback).
Because I had signed up for the Bigfoot 200 (and because my finances
are still tricky) I didn't attempt the Grand Slam.  Now that
Western States is over ([I finished it](2023/wser.md), which was my goal), I'm back to
a "fun around" block.

During my fun around block I typically "participate" (i.e., try to
finish) in a lot of events, but actually "race" (i.e., try to _win_ or
at least run quickly for my age) in very few.  This year, however,
since my foot is still giving me trouble, my highest priority will
be rehabilitating my foot, which may mean a lot of unicycling instead
of running.

Unfortunately, life has gotten in the way of writing up race reports,
so, as of late October 2023, although I have finished _almost_
everything I had planned for the year, I have written very little.
For some events I have notes and I hope to go back and write them up.

My fun around block ends in mid November, when I once again start
my hardcore training for BMDM.


## Events I'd Like to Enter

Here's what I have run in 2023 and what I'd like to run in the
remainder of the year.

I currently plan to race Javelina Jundred, in that I'd like to try for
a finish in under twenty hours.  I've started 2023 in a semi injured
state, so that seems overly ambitious, but historically I've healed
well, so that's still my plan.  JJ100 is still a long way away.
Besides, if I make _all_ my goals, I'm not setting them high enough.

Although I've included the Tucson Marathon in my 2023 plans, my
running it in 2022 adversely affected my training for the Bataan
Memorial Death March, but there were complicating factors (Jeanne's
surgery, my right foot's hot-spot).  In principle, I like qualifying
for Boston early, but of all the events on this list, the Tucson
Marathon is the one that will require extended scrutiny as it gets closer.

The `R` column is only checked when I plan to run very hard (e.g., to win
or to try to do well for my age).  Racing is annoyingly hard and lazy
is my middle name.

[^4]: It's really my "fuck around" block, but I mention the block by name a
lot on this page, so I've bowdlerized it everywhere but this footnote,
because I don't want to offend.

[^2]: I was given a dispensation to allow me to run to the Burque
Brew Crowning, run that event, and then run back and have all my mileage
count. As such, racked up 50 miles again this year.

[^1]: I registered for the Boston Marathon, but did not travel to
Boston to attend. I could not justify the expense, due to the state of
my right foot.  It was not sufficiently healthy to allow me to do the
Tough Ruck and although the Boston Marathon holds a special place in
my heart, my money was ridiculously tight.

[^6]: I was nervous that my foot might get too uncomfortable on the
backside, so I chose to return early with
[Labe](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Labe&lname=Kopelov). Labe
had only been back in Albuquerque for a few days and the altitude was
taking its toll. It was a great time to get to know him better.

[^7]: Rode with my brother-in-law who had a couple flats, so I lost a little
time. Also, made a wrong turn (or, perhaps, missed a turn). So, I finished
later than the desired 8 hour cut-off. I'll do better next year.

[^8]: Although it has no separate ruck division, I chose to race the Tatonka 5k while wearing my pack. It weighed 41.3 pounds.

[^5]: I was the five hour pace group leader.

[^3]: I like the Tucson marathon a lot. However, my step-mother, Jeanne,
no longer lives in the area, so I don't get to combine the Tucson marathon
with a chance to visit her.  Additionally, the Tucson marathon is in the
middle of my Bataan Memorial Death March training block.  In 2022, that
caused a little problem, because I already had an issue with my right foot
and _racing_ a marathon (to try to get 1st AG)&mdash;even without a pack&mdash;
pounds one's feet harder than most trainings. This year, not only do I
have some lingering issues with my right foot, at the end of the year I
was strapped both for cash and time, so I chose to stay in Albuquerque.
