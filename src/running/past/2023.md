# 2023

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Bataan Memorial Death March
2. Hardrock (or qualifier)
3. Fun Around

During my [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM) I have relatively few events.  I do
serious ruck training two and a half days a week. I had planned on
trying to participate in the Tough Ruck in 2023, but I nursed a
hot-spot in my right foot during my BMDM training and think it's
better to aim for Tough Ruck 2024 instead.

On March 19th, I finished the Bataan Memorial Death March.

My next block leads up to Hardrock (the next time I get in) or a
qualifier or two in the years I don't get in. This year, I did not get
in to Hardrock, although I did get in to Western States.  So I'm
hoping to complete the Cocodona 250 again as my Hardrock Qualifier.  I
had won the Bigfoot 200 lottery, but have to defer to 2024 since it
conflicts with [Acceptance
Day](https://www.westpoint.edu/parents/frequently-asked-questions#marchback).
Because I had signed up for the Bigfoot 200 (and because my finances
are still tricky) I won't be attempting the Grand Slam.  After
Western States, I'm back to a "fun around" block.

My "fun around" block ends in mid November.  During this block I
"participate" (i.e., try to finish) in a lot of events, but actually
"race" (i.e., try to _win_ or at least run quickly for my age) in very
few.

## Events I'd Like to Enter

Here's what I have run in 2023 and what I'd like to run in the
remainder of the year.

I currently plan to race Javelina Jundred, in that I'd like to try for
a finish in under twenty hours.  I've started 2023 in a semi injured
state, so that seems overly ambitious, but historically I've healed
well, so that's still my plan.  JJ100 is still a long way away.
Besides, if I make _all_ my goals, I'm not setting them high enough.

Although I've included the Tucson Marathon in my 2023 plans, my
running it in 2022 adversely affected my training for the Bataan
Memorial Death March, but there were complicating factors (Jeanne's
surgery, my right foot's hot-spot).  In principle, I like qualifying
for Boston early, but of all the events on this list, the Tucson
Marathon is the one that will require extended scrutiny as it gets closer.

The `R` column is only checked when I plan to run very hard (e.g., to win
or to try to do well for my age).  Racing is annoyingly hard and lazy
is my middle name.

[^2]: I was given a dispensation to allow me to run to the Burque
Brew Crowning, run that event, and then run back and have all my mileage
count. As such, racked up 50 miles again this year.

[^1]: I registered for the Boston Marathon, but did not travel to
Boston to attend. I could not justify the expense, due to the state of
my right foot.  It was not sufficiently healthy to allow me to do the
Tough Ruck and although the Boston Marathon holds a special place in
my heart, my money was ridiculously tight.

[^3]: I like the Tucson marathon a lot. However, my step-mother, Jeanne,
no longer lives in the area, so I don't get to combine the Tucson marathon
with a chance to visit her.  Additionally, the Tucson marathon is in the
middle of my Bataan Memorial Death March training block.  In 2022, that
caused a little problem, because I already had an issue with my right foot
and _racing_ a marathon (to try to get 1st AG)&mdash;even without a pack&mdash;
pounds one's feet harder than most trainings.
