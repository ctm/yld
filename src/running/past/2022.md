# 2022

I completed a lot of events in 2022, but I didn't start writing entries for
this book until I ran the Big Cottonwood Marathon in September.  So, the links
in the Event column are my event reports when I've written them or to
official times or Strava entries when I haven't.

My big race of 2022 was the Cocodona 250. I wound up doing it
without a crew or pacer, so I "ran" it very conservatively.  I was not
particularly beaten up at the end, so in the following week I ran 85
miles and rode my bike another 70.  Strava shows that I
"ran" 740 miles in May of 2022 and just over 3,000 in all of 2022.

The majority of entries in this table are races, but in most cases I did
not "race" them; I finished them at an enjoyable pace.  The non-races I've
included are mostly social training runs that I try to do every year.

[^1]: I "ran" the Cedro Peak 50k in a fasted state, and only consumed water until the third to last aid station when I had [a beer](https://santafebrewing.com/beer/adobe-igloo/).  At the next two aid stations I also had [a beer](http://www.exnovobrew.com/perle-haggard).  Those three beers were my only calories that day until after I had finished the race.

[^2]: The BARGE Fun Run is what got me started running (back in 2009!). It's a long story. However, in 2022, most of the participants did a 5k loop. I did that loop then ran back to join a walker.

[^3]: I was the five hour pace group leader.

[^4]: Although it has no separate ruck division, I chose to race the Tatonka 5k while wearing my pack. It weighed 41.8 pounds.
