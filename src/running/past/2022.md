# 2022

I completed a lot of events in 2022, but I didn't start writing entries for
this book until I ran the Big Cottonwood Marathon in September.

Eventually I'll flesh this page out at least as much as I did for 2021.

My "big" race of 2022 was the Cocodona 250. I wound up doing it
without a crew or pacer, so I "ran" it very conservatively.  I was not
particularly beaten up at the end, so in the following week I ran 85
miles and rode my bike another 75 (I think).  Strava shows that I
"ran" 740 miles in May of 2022 and just over 3,000 in all of 2022.
