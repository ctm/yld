# Tortugas Mountain 24 Hour Challenge 2022

## Overview

TODO (after I actually finish)

## Historical

The Tortuga Mountain 24 Hour Challenge started out as a drinking event, where
all participants were required to drink a beer before each 4 mile loop around
Tortugas Mountain (also known as "A" Mountain due to the capital 'A' in white
rock on the hill that is visible for miles).  The beer needed to be 12 ounces
or more and 5% ABV or more.

As the event became popular, some people chose to do it without all
the beer, so separate divisions were created.  These divisions are
recognized at the event itself, but are not made in the UltraSignup
results. So, you can either take my word or ask a race director, but
in 2021, I set a new course record of 14 beers and [56
miles](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=83711#id220546).

This year, I am the Duke City Marathon five hour pace group leader, so
I'm not entering the drinking division and will have no alcohol after
I go to bed.
