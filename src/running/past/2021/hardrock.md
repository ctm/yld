# Hardrock 2021

This was the biggie, but I didn't take notes
at the time.  My excellent team comprised JE: crew chief, SB: JE's
right hand man, PL: pacer from Grouse (mile 42.2) to Telluride (mile
72.8) and MW: pacer from Telluride to the finish line.  They did all
the work. I just had to hike, walk and run in a big circle with their
assistance.

I will come back and fill this in sometime.
