# Deadman Peaks 106 miler 2022

## Overview

It was chilly in temperature, but warm in atmosphere or perhaps that
was the two Santa Fe Brewing [7k IPA](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1683/289386/)s and the shot of Dewar's Whisky
that I had at the halfway point.

I [got 'er done](https://www.strava.com/activities/8080161623), but
will not write up a race report until after I've written up my JJ100
adventure.  And _that's_ the downside to running a hundred miler six
days after finishing a hundred miler: no time to write race reports.

Oh, and [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/8093196178) happened.
