# Tour of the Rio Grande 2022

## Overview

[Tour of the Rio Grande](https://www.torgbc.com/) is a bicycle event
that offers many different ride distances.  I chose to ride the
Century (100 miles). I had done this event in 2019 and wanted to do it
again, but it wasn't offered in 2020 and although it reappeared in
2021, it escaped my notice.  As centuries go, it's fairly easy in that
there's very little elevation change, but it's well done and is
surprisingly social considering the fact that they don't have a
post-ride beer garden.

It's not a race and&mdash;_temporarily_&mdash;being short of cash, I
chose to use the rest stop food rather than use Tailwind in my water
bottles.  That meant I stopped five times.  I'm also a big baby when
it comes to traffic, so I took a lot more time
([6:49:23](https://www.strava.com/activities/7867294235)) to finish
this supported 100 mile ride than I did on my last unsupported rest
day 100 miler
([6:07:31](https://www.strava.com/activities/7298799302)).

## Why?

I chose to ride ToRG for a few reasons. 

One is that my brother-in-law has gotten into biking and he and I were
going to ride some centuries this year, but he got injured. So,
although our centuries together are deferred to next year, I was
already looking forward to "them".  In reality, although [I
rode](https://www.strava.com/activities/7187704802) the [Santa Fe
Century](https://www.santafecentury.com/) earlier this year, I
probably won't be riding the [Day of the
Tread](https://dayofthetread.com/) Century a month from now, because
it conflicts with the [Albuquerque Road
Runners](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/) "[Forever
Young](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/forever-young-run.html)"
footrace.

Two, in theory, I run six days week and ride my bike on Sundays.  In
reality, I often skip the bike ride because I'm a fair weather rider,
especially after going over the handlebars due to me overly applying
the break when coming up on black ice.  Today, however, was good weather,
so sure!

Three, I plan on running the Tortugas Mountain 24 hour race in Las
Cruces on a Friday evening before returning to Albuquerque and then
being the five hour pace group leader for the Duke City Marathon on
the following Sunday, so by "running" (cough!) the AA 50k on Friday
evening and then riding the Tour of the Rio Grande the following
Sunday, I was able to make sure that the timing worked.

## Notes

Unlike three years ago, I only had to wait briefly at a train track crossing.
There was indeed a train on the rails when I got to the infamous crossing,
but it was a relatively short train and half of it had already passed.

There was a ton of roadkill out.  I must have seen at least a half
dozen dead raccoons, two or three skunks, a couple of dead porcupines
and even a coyote.  Although I don't recall seeing as much roadkill
three years ago, two data points isn't enough to draw any conclusions.

I didn't miss any of the signs that marked the course, but many people
did miss the turn for the first aid station.  That aid station is at
the Las Lunas Railrunner (the local "commuter" train) station, but you
have to take a left turn (on the way out) to get there.  It's at about
mile nineteen, but luckily (for the people who missed it), the second
aid station is at about mile 31/

Knowing that I was going to be stopping at all the aid stations and
that traffic (potentially including a train) might also slow me down,
I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to finish the ride in
the allotted seven hours, so &hellip; I drank a quad espresso just
before starting and another quad espresso at mile 50.  Perhaps that
was not a good choice, because I'm going to have a fair amount of
trouble sleeping at my normal time tonight.

I had injured my left knee when I fell at the Big Cottonwood Marathon
fifteen days ago.  My knee didn't give me any trouble at the AA 50k
Friday evening and it didn't give me any trouble on this century.
However, _right now_ about seven hours after finishing, my knee is
complaining.
