# My Beliefs

As I [mention elsewhere](../life/my-beliefs.md), I have a ton of
beliefs and I'm sure many are wrong.

This section is for my running beliefs. Eventually, I may add belief
sub-sections to Programming, Poker and perhaps even Bataan.

I get the [runner's
high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Ht2MLJD8U).  The runner's high
used to be explained by endorphins.  It's now explained by
endocannabinoids.  Who knows, for me it might actually be nothing more
than the placebo effect.  I still, however, _often_ get the runner's
high.
