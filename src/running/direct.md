# Events I Direct

I am a reluctant, exceedingly minimalist (lazy is my middle name), race
director.  I may get better as time goes on or I may shed my RD duties.
I certainly don't want to be a race director, per-se, but I don't want
the Baldy 50k to go away as long as there is still interest in it.
