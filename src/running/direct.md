# Events I Direct

I am a reluctant, exceedingly minimalist (lazy is my middle name),
race director.  I may get better as time goes on or I may shed my RD
duties.  I don't want to be a race director, per-se, but I don't want
the Baldy 50k, or any of the Albuquerque Fat Ass races, to go away as
long as there is still interest in them.
