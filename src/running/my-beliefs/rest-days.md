# Rest Days

I believe rest days are exceedingly important to my weekly training,
but I do not believe that I need to be placed in a medically induced
coma on rest days.  In fact, I run, ride my bike, hike, unicycle and
even do my core exercises (sit-ups, push-ups and unweighted squats) on
what I sincerely claim are rest days.

My criterion is simple, I ask myself if what I'm doing is at a low
enough effort level for the amount of time I do it to make it (after
eating well and getting a good night's sleep) restful. That generally
means that speed work, ruck runs and high volume (i.e. > 50k) preclude
the day from being a rest day.

Riding a flat 100 miles on a bicycle, [can be a rest
day](https://www.strava.com/activities/7298799302), if I keep my heart
rate around 130bpm or below, even if I do it in a fasted state and
completely in high gear, _but_ it won't be a rest day if I'm not
already accustomed to riding that long.

So, my typical schedule is to run six days a week and ride my bicycle or
a unicycle on Sundays.  The Sunday ride is almost always a rest day, because
I typically do a long run on Saturday and try to do speed work on Monday.
I can easily believe that I *might* get better results if I do even less
on my rest days, but if I don't exercise at all, that tends to cause me to
both have trouble sleeping and gain weight and both of those interfere with
my training and performance.

I do my core exercises on Tuesdays and Thursdays and then "run" after
doing them. My distance may even be 15.5 miles, but if I'm out of
shape (for me), then I may walk quite a bit in those miles.  On the
other hand, when I'm doing that distance regularly on rest days, I
might be jogging the entire time.

Bear in mind, one of the big adaptations I want (and get!) out of my
body is the ability to do long distances, slowly, in close succession,
whether that is doing a two hundred miler or doing the Deadman Peaks
Trail Run 106 miler six days after running the Javelina Jundred.

I log my runs and rides (but not my core exercises) to
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205), so you can see my
how I let my body rest between my hard days.
