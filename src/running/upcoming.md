# Upcoming Events

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Bataan Memorial Death March
2. Hardrock (or qualifier)
3. Fun Around

I'm currently in my [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.  If finances permit, I'll also race the Tough Ruck on April
16th, 2023.

My next block leads up to Hardrock (the next time I get in) or a
qualifier or two in the years I don't get in. This year, I did not get
in to Hardrock, although I did get in to Western States.  So the
Bigfoot 200 will be my Hardrock Qualifier, and I won't be attempting
the Grand Slam.  After Bigfoot, I'm back to a "fun around" block.

My "fun around" block ends in mid November.  During this block I
"participate" (i.e., try to finish) in a lot of events, but actually
"race" (i.e., try to _win_ or at least run quickly for my age) in very
few.

## Events I'd Like to Enter

Here's what I'd like to run in the remainder of 2022 and in 2023.  My
participation in the Tough Ruck and Cocodona 250 is predicated on me
successfully financing [craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com), which
looks promising, but is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's
shareholders are my highest priority. However, my running and rucking
seem to help me at work.

The "Racing" column is only yes when I plan to run very hard (e.g., to win
or to try to do well for my age).  Racing is hard and annoying and lazy
is my middle name.
