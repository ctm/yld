# Upcoming Events

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Fun Around
2. Bataan Memorial Death March
3. Hardrock (or qualifier)

I'm currently in my "fun around" training block; it ends in mid
November.  During this block I participate in a lot of events, but
actually race in very few.

After that I am in a [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.

My final block leads up to Hardrock (if I get in) or a qualifier (for
2023, Ehunmilak) if I don't.  After that, I'm back to a "fun around"
block.

## Events I'll Probably Participate In

Although my schedule for the rest of 2022 is fairly well defined, many
of the 2023 events I hope to participate in have not yet been
announced or involve a lottery that I must win in order to get into.

Additionally, my participation is predicated on me successfully
launching [craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com), which looks
promising, but is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's
shareholders are my highest priority, however, my running and rucking
seem to help me at work.
