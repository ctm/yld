# Upcoming Events

## Three training blocks

For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.

1. Fun Around
2. Bataan Memorial Death March
3. Hardrock (or qualifier)

I'm currently in my "fun around" training block; it ends in mid
November.  During this block I participate in a lot of events, but
actually race in very few.

After that I am in a [serious training
block](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March) for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.

My final block leads up to Hardrock (if I get in) or a qualifier or
two if I don't get in. Actually, even if I do get in to Hardrock, I'll be
running the Bigfoot 200, but if my finances are secure, and I don't
get in to Hardrock, I'll also run Ehunmilak.  After that, I'm back to
a "fun around" block.

## Events I'll Probably Participate In

Here's what I think I'll be running in the remainder of 2022 and in 2023.
I'm signed up for everything (other than King of the Hill which isn't
taking registrations yet) through the Bataan Memorial Death March
and a few events after that.  My participation in the Tough Ruck and
Cocodona 250 is predicated on me successfully launching
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com), which looks promising, but
is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's shareholders are my
highest priority. However, my running and rucking seem to help me at
work.
