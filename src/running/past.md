# Events I've Participated In

Over the years I've participated in more than a couple of hundred events.
I often take notes to myself before and afterward; I've even written the
occasional event report and mailed it to a few friends.  Unless asked,
I don't plan on digging up any of that old information, but I will
take a stab at documenting my experiences here.

Although these reports are for me, if you have a question about
anything I've written here, [send me
email](mailto:clifford.t.matthews@gmail.com). Similarly, if you have a
question about any of the events I've participated in that I haven't
documented here, [send me
email](mailto:clifford.t.matthews@gmail.com).  Most of my longer
events are listed on my [UltraSignup
page](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews). I'm
also a member of [Marathon
Maniacs](https://www.marathonmaniacs.com/); which [lists my marathon or longer events](https://db.marathonmaniacs.com/Maniacs/myraces/4395).
