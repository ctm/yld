# DNFs

UltraSignup doesn't always list the entrants who Did Not Finish (DNF).
So, for completeness, these are, I believe, all the times I've started
a race and not officially finished:

|Year|Race|Reason|
|----|----|------|
|2010|Deadman Peaks Trail Run 50 miler|WNATF: Was Not Allowed To Finish[^1]|
|2014|Cedro Peak 45 miler|Flu caught up with me|
|2015|Western States|SAR injury[^2]|
|2015|Leadville|Same SAR injury + didn't pay attention to cutoffs|
|2016|Bighorn 100 Miler|Trekking pole broke|
|2016|Fat Dog 120|Different trekking pole broke + bad nutrition; [finished but too late](https://runningjohn.blogspot.com/2016/08/2016-mountain-madness-fat-dog-120-race.html)|
|2019|Foothills 50k|White-out blizzard (nobody finished)|

Eventually, I'll write up a race report for each of those, because I
think DNFs are more noteworthy (and unique) than other race reports.


### Cancellation Mid Race

In addition to the above, the Jemez Mountain Trail Run 50 miler was
canceled due to a sudden storm while I and most others were out on the
course in 2014.  There were [only 20
finishers](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=24424) that
year.  The storm caught everyone by surprise and even some of the aid
station volunteers were going hypothermic.  I believe a few entrants went
to the hospital, but nobody died.

### Did Not Start

Although I had a covid rollover entry to the 2021 Santa Fe Century, I
chose not to start.  Initially, I had planned to, but it was during
[Balloon Fiesta](https://balloonfiesta.com/) and the day after the
[AA50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/).  Between my
Balloon Fiesta drinking and my AA50k drinking, I was just not healthy
enough to want to ride SFC in horrible weather.

[^1]: It was the Race Director's first race and my first ultra.  I barely
made the turnaround cutoff and I looked dodgy.  RD radioed down to the aid
station captain at the next aid station and requested I be examined for fitness
when I arrived.  There was no cutoff, but I was cut anyway.

[^2]: I injured my foot in a search-and-rescue mission in May, but
continued to train on it a little longer than I should have.  I did
realize that it wasn't healing properly and did back off, not soon
enough.  I ran the first thirty some miles with a limp.  I then took
analgesics and the limp went away, but I was in crazy pain and
semi-hunched over.  I missed a turnoff and went a long way up a hill
(misleading others off course, too).  The others recovered (including
[one spectacular&mdash;record
breaking&mdash;finish]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqKinAETu8E)),
but I had to drop at mile 85.
