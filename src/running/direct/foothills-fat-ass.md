# Foothills Fat Ass

This page complements the official [Foothills Fat
Ass](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/foothills-50k/) page by
providing four useful GPX files and a few tables.

The event starts at the Michael Emery Trailhead Parking lot and, depending
on the distance one chooses, consists of one, two or three out-and-backs,
known as the 10k, the 50k southern section and the 50k northern section, all
three of which are done by the 50k participants.  Here are the GPX files
for each:

## AllTrails

These four routes can be seen in [my AllTrails
Maps](https://www.alltrails.com/members/clifford-matthews-1/maps)
collection, even without an AllTrails account, although you'll need an
AllTrails account to download from their site.

## Distance Descriptions

### 5k

Head **half-way** (i.e., 1.55 miles) up the 10k route, turn around, come back.

### 10k

Head up the 10k route, return.

### Half Marathon

Do the 10k route, then head down the 50k Southern Section to the
Menaul Parking Lot, return.

This route includes 2.6 miles of asphalt, which is kind of a lot for a half
marathon, but it's there to encourage you to do the marathon or 50k next year.
There's no guarantee there will even be a next year, much less that we'll
have the same course, but that stretch of asphalt has been with us since
the beginning (2012), _I think_.

|Cumulative|Segment|Where|
|---------:|-------|-----|
| 0.0|6.2|Start|
| 6.2|3.7|Start/Finish after out-and-back|
| 9.9| 3.7|Menaul Parking Lot turnaround|
| 13.6||Finish|

### Marathon

Do the 10k and the Southern Section, then run a total of four miles
that brings you back to the Finish (e.g., run two miles out and then two
miles back).

This route includes 2.6 miles of asphalt, which is an unavoidable tax.
If you want to pay less than a 10% asphalt tax, step up to the 50k
next (or this!) year.

|Cumulative|Segment|Where|
|---------:|-------|-----|
| 0.0|6.2|Start|
| 6.2|3.7|Start/Finish after out-and-back|
| 9.9| 9.3|Menaul Parking Lot heading south|
|19.2| 3.7|Menaul Parking Lot heading north|
|22.9|3.3|Start/Finish after southern section, run 1.65 miles using any path, return|
|26.2||Finish|

### Alternate&mdash;Less Social&mdash;Marathon

Do only the Southern Section and Northern Sections (i.e., skip the
10k), but do them in entirety.  The downside is that you don't get to
run with all the other runners who start with the same 10k
out-and-back. On the other hand, you get to do the southern loop at
the end of the Southern Section (you get to run almost to I-40).

|Cumulative|Segment|Where|
|---------:|-------|-----|
| 0.0|3.7|Start|
| 3.7|9.3|Menaul Parking Lot heading south|
|13.0|3.7|Menaul Parking Lot heading north|
|16.7|4.8|Start/Finish after southern section|
|21.5|4.8|Base of the Tram|
|26.3||Finish|


### 50k

This route includes 2.6 miles of unavoidable asphalt, but it's still **much**
better than 2023, when we had something like twelve miles of asphalt.

Do the 10k, the Southern Section and then the Northern Section.  The
Northern Section is basically Trail 365, although there's a minor
short-cut in the south that prevents a little backtracking and another
minor short-cut that takes you into the Wilderness area as you get
close to the tram.  If you choose to though, you can take Trail 365
the entire way and it won't add much more than a mile or two.

|Cumulative|Segment|Where|
|---------:|-------|-----|
| 0.0|6.2|Start|
| 6.2|3.7|Start/Finish after out-and-back|
| 9.9| 9.3|Menaul Parking Lot heading south|
|19.2| 3.7|Menaul Parking Lot heading north|
|22.9|4.8|Start/Finish after southern section|
|27.7|4.8|Base of the Tram|
|32.5||Finish|
