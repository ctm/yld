# Chimney Melon 50k

This page complements the official [Chimney Melon
50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/) page by
providing the best GPX file of the course.  I don't have a perfect one.

This one is marred slightly by me going off course a little bit in the
beginning between the parking lot at the base of the Tram and where
the path of the Tramway Trail is straightforward and strictly ascending.
If I remember correctly, if you follow these tracks exactly and backtrack
where I made the mistake, it'll add less than a hundred yards, so you
don't have to fear that these tracks will greatly mislead you.

I made these tracks on September 3rd, 2022, doing the course on my
own, for fun.

[My activity is on
Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7750124403), but you're not
allowed to download the GPX if you don't have an account, so here it
is: [GPX file](chimney_melon_50k/Chimney_Melon_50k_course.gpx)
