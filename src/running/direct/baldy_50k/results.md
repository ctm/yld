I'll try to get these onto webscorer, but for now, they're here.  Normally
people have to finish by 9pm for it to count, but that rule was relaxed this
year due to the excessive blowdown.

George and I slowed down significantly on the way out to Johnson Lake
as we did some trail maintenance. We employed all sorts of tricks
(with no injuries in this universe) to improve things: primarily
moving, breaking, bending and kicking.  However, there was still more
blowdown that we couldn't improve than the amount we did improve. So,
I doubt anyone who came after us would even notice our handiwork.

The weather was very nice.  No thunder or lightning or even rain. It
was mostly overcast.  My truck claims it was 42F at about 7:30am and
51F at 8:20pm.

The timings below are from each of the participant's Strava tracks.  I'll
ask James and Spencer if they'd prefer to tie for 3rd since they both
came in together.
