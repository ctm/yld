However, I placed them here before I put them there, so I'm leaving
them here as well.  Normally people have to finish by 9pm for it to
count, but that rule was relaxed this year due to the excessive
blowdown.

George and I slowed down significantly on the way out to Johnson Lake
as we did some trail maintenance. We employed all sorts of tricks
(with no injuries in this universe) to improve things: primarily
moving, breaking, bending and kicking.  However, there was still more
blowdown that we couldn't improve than the amount we did improve. So,
I doubt anyone who came after us would even notice our handiwork.

The weather was very nice.  No thunder or lightning or even rain. It
was mostly overcast.  My truck claims it was 42F at about 7:30am and
51F at 8:20pm.
