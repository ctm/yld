# Programming

I'm more of a programmer than I am a runner.

Although most of this book is just running race reports, that's because I'm
trying to write something for each of my events and I do a lot of events.  In
the past I wrote up notes to myself and I thought it wouldn't take that much
more time to write reports I could share with my family or my crazy friends.
Turns out I'm a slow writer in addition to being a slow runner.

Anyway, most of my programming time these days is spent writing
[mb2](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/), and mb2 has its own
[issue tracker](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues).  So although I
write more programming prose than running prose, little of it shows
up here.

However, before mb2, I created some semi-notable software,
including
[Executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software))[^1] and
[multibot](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/thanks/multibot.html)[^2]. Executor gave [Sam
Lantinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lantinga) an excuse to
write [SDL](https://libsdl.org/). Although Sam probably would have
created SDL regardless, I still got a nice shout-out in [SDL's
Credits](https://libsdl.org/credits.php).

For now, I'll just add a page to the programming section every once in
a while, typically when I've already written the text as an email for one
reason or another.

[^1]: Steve Jobs called me at home when I was in bed with pneumonia
and I did not handle the call well.  [John Perry
Barlow](https://www.stone.com/barlow/) used Executor but his literal
first words to me in person were "You're an asshole." I'll write up
those two stories if there's any interest.

[^2]: Multibot was the first software to deal multi-table poker tournaments on
the internet. You won't find it via a web search though, because I sold it
to Poker School Online where it was used for years. If there's interest, I'll
write more on multibot.
