# Programming

I'm more of a programmer than I am a runner.

Although most of the pages in this book are currently devoted to
running, that's mostly just due to my use of this book to mostly write
notes to myself.  Most of my programming time these days is spent
writing [mb2](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/), and it has
its own [issue tracker](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues).

However, before mb2, I created some other semi-notable software,
including
[Executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software))[^1] and
[multibot](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/thanks/multibot.html)[^2]. Executor gave [Sam
Lantinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lantinga) an excuse to
write [SDL](https://libsdl.org/). Although Sam probably would have
created SDL regardless, I still got a nice shout-out in [SDL's
Credits](https://libsdl.org/credits.php).

For now, I'll just add a page to the programming section every once in
a while, typically when I've already written the text as an email for one
reason or another.

[^1]: Steve Jobs called me at home when I was in bed with pneumonia
and I did not handle the call well.  [John Perry
Barlow](https://www.stone.com/barlow/) used Executor but his literal
first words to me in person were "You're an asshole." I'll write up
those two stories if there's any interest.

[^2]: Multibot was the first software to deal multi-table poker tournaments on
the internet. You won't find it via a web search though, because I sold it
to Poker School Online where it was used for years. If there's interest, I'll
write more on multibot.
