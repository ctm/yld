# Unicycling

Da fuq? Unicycling isn't running.

True.  However, after the foot injury that started in November 2022 lasted
through my BMDM training, my Cocodona 250 "run" and Western States, I've
decided to let the foot heal.  Taking a spill on July 1st and bruising one
or more ribs cemented the deal.

So, now that I'm in my "Fun Around" training block, I'm going to
rejuvenate my unicycling skill so that I'll be ready to buy a
[mountain
unicycle](https://gazette.com/pikespeakcourier/not-a-circus-act-mountain-unicycling-is-serious-business-in-colorado/article_167e2d4e-45ac-11ed-a818-07f6c947a4ba.html)
by the time there is snow in the Sandias. Then, assuming I get
permission from the race director, I'll train for and compete in the
[White Mountains 100](https://wm100.endurancenorth.org/), a 100 mile
race in Alaska at the end of March. Yes, it's been [done
before](https://www.peninsulaclarion.com/life/fairbanks-unicyclist-completes-100-mile-race/).

## Craft Poker Outsiders' Fun Club

It may take me a while to get it off the ground, but I'm starting the
[Craft Poker Outsiders' Fun
Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/682818577003329), a group to
encourage people to get physically outside (if it will benefit them)
and/or to get outside their comfort zone (if it will benefit them)
rather than staying indoors and participating in addictive behavior.

## Background

I'm sort of cheating by choosing unicycling as an example of me getting outside
my comfort zone, because I used to be an OK unicyclist, "back in the day."
At one point I owned five unicycles:
* A 20" diameter wheeled one I used for teaching unicycling
* "My own" 20" diameter wheeled one (that wasn't quite so beaten up)
* A 24" diameter wheeled unicycle for commuting
* A 5' chain driven giraffe
* A 36" diameter unicycle[^1] made by Tom Miller of [The Unicycle Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWPwJsU7vSM)

OTOH, I'll be 61 for the 2024 White Mountains 100 and I really haven't unicycled
much in the last thirty years.

Salomon Brothers. I
commuted to work from Battery Park City to their place on Water Street (before
they moved to 7 WTC).
