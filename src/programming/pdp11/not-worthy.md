Those are serious people who did serious work.  Go ahead and do a web
search and see for yourself. You may need to tweak the names a bit,
e.g., [Bill Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Bill_Joy). I am less
than serious (although I am driven).

My contribution to ULTRIX-11 was
["Ulf"](https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=Ultrix-3.1/src/cmd/help/helptext4),
the &lt;cough>Universal&lt;/cough> Lineprinter Filter. It supported **two** formats: the
[Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_630) and a generic
(might work with other printers).  The Diablo printer might print
faster if every other line was printed backward, because then you
didn't have to wait for the print head to be restored to the first
column as you would if every line were printed left to right. So, I
wrote a filter to support that functionality.  The generic format was
simply to print left to right the entire time. IOW, it was a tiny hack
for a very limited gain.

It's been too long for me to be sure; I may have done something else
to get my name in that paragraph, but I can guarantee the sum of my
contributions was completely inconsequential.

I only added this page because a good friend, after reading my PDP-8 pages
had said:
> I "grew up" on a PDP-11 programming&hellip;

she used scare quotes because we both know she's never grown up. Some
people don't.
