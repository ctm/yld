# Rust

I don't have any content for this page, but if you got here, I
encourage you to [learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).  It's
super worthwhile, especially if you're getting on in years and easily
forget stuff.

I would not have been able to write
[mb2](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/) in any other
language.  I wrote multibot in Objective-C, but multibot was nowhere
near as flexible as mb2.  For example, multibot dealt only Texas
Hold'em, Seven Card Stud and Omaha.  Mb2 [deals over fifty
games](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/games.html).
