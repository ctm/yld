# Ancient Peripherals

I've used toggle switches, slow (i.e., 110 baud) paper tape, DECtape,
RM03s, RM05s, RK05s and other ridiculously large magnetic media that
stored tiny amounts of data.  I can only think of a few stories about
any of them that might warrant writing down.  Anyone who worked with
DEC equipment back in the day played with almost all of that stuff.

I do, however, have a relatively uncommon [punch card
story](./ancient-peripherals/punch-cards.md).
