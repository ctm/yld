# A Public Life

Greetings. I'm [Cliff Matthews](https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20)
([Team RWB](https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056),
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205)), aka Clifford
Matthews
([UltraSignup](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cliffordmatthews3529)),
aka deadhead ([BARGE](https://www.barge.org/),
[devctm](https://devctm.com/), [Marathon
Maniacs](https://db.marathonmaniacs.com/Maniacs/myraces/4395)),
aka ctm ([GitHub](https://github.com/ctm), [Albuquerque Game
Developers Guild](https://agdg.co/)) aka nmdeadhead
([Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/nmdeadhead/), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/nmdeadhead), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nmdeadhead)). Although I
don't wear a tinfoil hat, I _am_ concerned with privacy, albeit I'm
more concerned with yours than mine.

I don't have a Facebook or Instagram account. I do have a [LinkedIn
account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/),
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. 

Over the years, I've tossed various random stuff into [public
repositories](https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories) in my GitHub
account. In 2016 I chose to publicly document [the
training](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md)
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so I've
continued that tradition and slowly added more info that people may or
may not find handy.

Currently, on a typical week I run for a couple hours or more on
Mondays through Saturdays and ride my bike for several hours on
Sunday.  This gives me a lot of time to think and record voice notes.
I'm planning to dump some of my thoughts into this book.  It's like
I'm writing up thoughts for a younger version of myself and equally
pointless.  I don't (yet!) have a time machine and the early model of
Young Lazy Deadhead listened to no one.
