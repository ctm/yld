# I used toâ€¦

[&hellip; take drugs. I still do, but I _used to_](https://twitter.com/M_Hedberg/status/613196872144977920), too[^1]. Also, I used to be a dick.

Needling people who were playing poker with me at BARGE, was fun, especially when I was drinking.

## Background

I typically played the Pot Limit Omaha game and then when Bingo invented Binglaha, I played that. I thought it was all in fun, although I did see that people would tilt and that I'd benefit from it. This was when I was working for other people and so I had plenty of cash. I would do things like not look at my cards and tell people I wasn't looking at my cards. I'd also tell them that I would lie about whether or not I'd looked. Then I'd tell them that I hadn't looked, but that I lie about it. Sometimes I'd look. I thought it was great fun, because it allowed me to sometimes bet hard on an unknown hand and then when the opponent folded, I'd flip over a completely random hand. Other times I'd know I had the nuts or a huge wrap or whatever. 

I do not even know if I was an overall winning player, because I didn't track my wins and losses and even if I was +EV, there's no way my EV matched what I could make per hour as a consultant. If I was -EV, it wasn't a huge amount either. There were definitely swings, but to me it was all great fun. I tilted one [Tilt Boy](https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Tiltboys/dp/1596701404) hard enough that he slammed his chips into the table and actually broke a $25 chip. He was a bit embarrassed, and he actually appreciated the fact that I was able to tilt him.

## Kaboom

On one hand, though I managed to get another BARGEr in all-in on something like me having top set and my opponent having middle set. I had been needling him to get his money in and when we turned over our cards, he absolutely blew up. He flew out of his chair and cursed me out and it wasn't in fun or jest. He was pissed. He was pissed at me and he was pissed at my dickish play. I felt absolutely horrible because to me it was all fun and games and I didn't know anyone was taking it personally.

I don't know what happened in other universes, but in this one, the all-in player caught his case card and won the pot. He later apologized to me for blowing up and gave me a hundred dollar bill.

AFAIK, I had gotten along well with that player, although I didn't know him particularly well, before that incident, but I definitely reigned in my act after that. I used to especially delight in tilting the locals, because what would happen is there would be a table full of BARGErs and a local would want to play and then all sorts of BARGE shenanigans would ensue and that would make the local susceptible to tilt. However, I also especially enjoyed titing BARGErs, 'cause ... well ... to be honest ... tilting BARGErs.

I am not a mean spirited person. I do, however, have a sense of humor that can overstep bounds. I also used to have the attitude: it's (BARGE) poker; they should take it and like it. However, we all play for different reasons even though there may be very large overlapping reasons between subgroups and we've all had different life experiences. When I realized I was actually being mean--even though that wasn't my intent--I changed to not be (IMO, and it's hard to judge oneself). FWIW, I don't always succeed. I was a bit of a dick to my daughter yesterday at lunch, not because I meant to be, but because I was drinking and old habits die hard...
