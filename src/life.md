# Life

Greetings. I'm Cliff Matthews aka Lazy Young deadhead.

I'm alive. Or I've died, and nobody has updated this page.

I'm dumping some of my thoughts into this book.  It's like I'm writing
for a younger version of myself and equally pointless.  I don't (yet!)
have a time machine and the early model of Young Lazy Deadhead
listened to no one.
