# Running

I run a lot. I'm also the race director for the [Baldy
50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/) and the [Chimney
Melon
50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/),
which are two of the events in the [Albuquerque Fat Ass
Series](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/).

The Albuquerque Fat Ass Series is hosted (for free, thanks!) on
wordpress.com and as such it can't host the GPX files that
participants might want, so I host them here.

On Thursday, August 12th, 2021 [I gave](http://www.abqroadrunners.com/uploads/6/7/7/6/6776981/arr_newsletter_2021.august.pdf),
to the [Albuquerque Road Runners](https://www.abqroadrunners.com/), a
brief presentation on my Hardrock 2021 experience. I had planned on writing
up the notes in this book and then using them to guide my presentation,
but instead I just had a few beers and talked everyone's ears off.  So,
I have to get into Hardrock again so I can do it right next time.

In my early ultra running years I benefited greatly from various
blogs, including, but by no means limited to, [Studies in
Clydeology](https://clydeologist.blogspot.com/), [The Athena
Diaries](https://athenadiaries.blogspot.com/), [Club
Dread](https://dreadpiraterackham.blogspot.com/), and [the Pink
Corker's](https://pinkcorker.blogspot.com/).  Often these blog writers
had done events that I was contemplating entering and their insights
helped prepare me.

However, I'm always doing something and if I had to write a good blog
entry for a race, I'd never finish (because I'm a bad writer, a
procrastinator and someone whose memory won't remember details when I
want to write them down and whose impatience won't write memories down
when I still have them). So, instead of a blog, I'm sort of doing a
book, and I'm using GitHub so that I can change things over time, but
not in a sneaky way to pretend I didn't say something that later turns
out embarrassing, but to allow me to eventually cut dross and provide
useful information rather than a quick brain dump.
