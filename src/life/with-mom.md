# With Mom

On June 3rd, 2024&mdash;with no advance warning, per-se&mdash;I moved into
my mother's house to become her minder.

This has, IMO, worked out very well for her, considering.

Mom had a stroke at age 91, on March 27th, 2024. She was away from home,
in the ICU, a private room and in in-patient rehab, seventeen days,
getting back on the 13th of April, 2024. She could no longer live alone,
so Marcia, my sister, moved in to be mom's minder.

Marcia was overwhelmed, so I took over.

This section of the book has a few pages associated with what transpired
in the intervening year and I'll probably add notable changes as they come in.

I too, however, have been overwhelmed and I've let many things drop on
the floor, occasionally viciously unprioritized, except for mom.  As
such, although I'm carving out time to add a couple "Mom pages", I
won't spend much time composing or editing them, and overall, my work
on this book will be postopned until I truly have free time.
