# My Beliefs

I have a ton of beliefs and I'm sure many are wrong.  I don't, however,
deliberately choose to be contrarian or controversial, much less choose
to be deliberately wrong.  I have more confidence in some of my beliefs
than others.

I believe in unarticulated knowledge as well as misarticulated knowledge.
The former is roughly that there are things that work, but aren't explained,
the latter is there are things that work that are explained incorrectly.
For example, one can compute the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle
by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each of the two
other sides.  This works even if I misexplain the Pythagorean theorem.
