# Multiple Universes

After describing some ridiculous thing I did in my youth (and
remember, I'm still young, so it could have been yesterday) I often
say that I believe in multiple universes and in most of them I'm dead
and my mom is sad.  I then add that in a few, I'm dead and my mother
is ecstatic.  Am I being serious when I say that?  No.  In _this_
universe, it's more a tangential commentary on [expected
value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value).  In other
universes I'm dead serious.
