# Laziness

I try to do more of what pushes me in the direction that I want to go
and less of that which sends me in a different direction or pulls me
back.  Over time, I've accumulated a number of practices that _seem_ to
work _for me_.

Some of it is counter-intuitive, like getting up at the same time
every day.  I've done it for so long now, that it's second nature.

I do core exercises at 5:15am almost every Tuesday and Thursday.  For
years I struggled with doing my core exercise.  Nothing I did seemed
to stick; it was always annoying and easy to fall off the wagon.  Two
things that didn't seem like a big deal were holding me back.  I used
to do them every other day, and I'd do them at different times of day.
Eventually (in April of 2019), I settled on only doing them Tuesdays
and Thursdays (after a brief experiment with doing them on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Sundays).  That helped, but I was still doing them at
random times, depending on what was in my inbox when I first woke up.
By mid August of 2021 I settled on doing my core exercise at 5:15am
(which is when I drink my daily double espresso). It made doing them
easier, and because I'm lazy, I like easier.

I also used to read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)
at random times, often spending more time there than I should.
Eventually I gravitated to reading Hacker News on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, looking for interesting articles or discussions to read as
I did my unweighted squats.  I do my core exercises at home, because
I'm too lazy to go to a gym.
