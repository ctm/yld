# Soy

FWIW, having this page in my "Life" section makes it sound like soy is an
important part of my life, which is an overstatement, but putting
it under "Running" would be too specific.

I believe the amount of soy, of the type I eat, is good for me.  I
don't have man boobs, and although I'm not muscular, per-se, I do very
well in the Bataan Memorial Death March heavy division and do OK in the
Mount Taylor Winter Quadrathlon. Both of those require a fair amount
of leg and core strength.

I haven't had my testosterone measured, but I'd be very surprised to
find that it's low. Someday, when I'm flush with cash, I'll get it
checked.

I've been eating soy long before [this
article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-soy-bad-for-you) came
out, bit it appears to be a worthwhile summary.

Pretty much everything I've eaten starting March 31st, 2018 is
[online](https://github.com/ctm/diet), so you can see for yourself how
much and what types of soy I eat, but it's basically 2 cups of soy
milk a day in my two servings of [fortified
oatmeal](https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt),
with occasional tofu, tempeh and edamame.  In general, I don't eat
"junk" food with soy isolates or fake meat made with soy.
