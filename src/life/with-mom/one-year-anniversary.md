# One Year Anniversary

I wrote this page on Tuesday, June 3rd, 2025 after completing an
important urgent task for Craft Poker Co. This lets people know some
of what's been happening with my mom and me. It also documents things
that I may forget.

## How it started

Before mom had her stroke, she was having some cognitive issues that
suggested she was experiencing a slide into senility.  Her stroke had
both physical and mental manifestations, but she was so messed up that
it was hard to judge what was stroke and what was senility.

Mom came out of in-patient rehab needing many changes to her house and
a special walker that gave more stability.  Her thinking was
disorganized.  She made many sequencing errors.  By the time I moved
in with her, she had made great progress, but still was receiving
in-home physical, speech and occupational therapy.

Prior to her stroke, mom would walk a .66 mile loop and stop and rest
twice, using her walker with a built in seat.  She didn't return to
that route until I moved in with her.  I had her join Strava and [we
tried that loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/11566861975). In
[my tracks](https://www.strava.com/activities/11567461433), I can see
that we stopped at the two spots she used to stop.

I'm glad I thought to put mom on Strava, but I didn't take any baseline
measurements, per-se. However, Marcia had already started taking mom's
blood pressure every day.  I continued that policy and have dutifully
entered that data into her iPhone's health app.

I track quite a bit about myself, but much less more about mom.  One
thing I don't track for either of us, but I do pay attention to is
knee discomfort.  I've found, over the years, that when **I** have
knee discomfort, [running helps](../../running/my-beliefs/knees.md)
("motion is lotion") more often than not.  In the first few months
there times when she,
[e.g.](https://www.strava.com/activities/13074881707), had some
soreness in one or both of her knees and typically we'd just head back
to the house and not walk any more that day.

I don't know what mom's weight was then, nor do I know what it was
now.  I do know that she was a size 14, because recently she's had to
buy new clothes due to her weight loss.

Mom was on six drugs, including baby aspirin and one that lists dementia
as a possible side-effect.  The description for that drug on a UK NHS
site says that people should be on it for as little time as possible and
that a doctor would check every six to twelve months to see if it could
be reduced. We do not live in the UK and AFAIK, nobody was checking on
her ability to reduce that drug.

In addition to taking care of mom, I now had to take care of mom's
ancient cat who needs a special diet and has to be fed several
(approximately eleven) times a day.  The cat also needs her litter box
cleaned several times a day or she will deliberately pee outside it to
make a point.

## How it's going

Mom walks more now than she has in decades.  I typically take her for
a walk in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Yesterday, June
2nd, a storm was supposed to arrive that would preclude her afternoon
walk, so&mdash;with her agreement&mdash;I took her on [her longest
walk to date](https://www.strava.com/activities/14672439777). It was
1.99 miles according to her phone and took her just under an hour and
a quarter.

The only drug mom is on now is the baby aspirin. I still don't know
how much mom weighs, but she's recently bought size 10 clothes.  Her
blood pressure graph from the last year shows a slow but steady
decrease, although the graph provided by Apple's health app isn't in
itself _super_ informative.  However, she was on meds for hypertension
_before_ her stroke and I've weaned her off them and she has a better
blood pressure than she had before her stroke when she was on them.

Although I don't track either mom's or my knee discomfort, mom has
rarely mentioned knee discomfort in the last few months.  It appears
that increased walking improved her knees.

Each day, as I walk with mom we converse.  At certain points on our walk
I tend to ask her questions about information she's learned post-stroke.
Initially, it started with a single question, which was what is the name
for that big wheeled bicycle that I'd point to.  I had told her that it
was a penny farthing, but that didn't stick.  Often, I'd have to give
her hints.  We even looked up the definition of a farthing and she has
a niece whose name is Penny. The variance associated with her recall made
things surreal, but there was slow, but steady improvement.

It would take far too long for me to write down the memory games/tests
we play each day on our walks, but over time we went from just the
penny farthing to the name of the person who lives at the house that
has the penny farthing in the yard (it turns out to be a cousin of my
wife) to the names of a dog and the dog's owner at another place in
the walk as well as the name of her next door neighbor and his dog and
a couple different types of cactus (cholla and prickly pair).  The
interesting thing to me is she has historically had the most problem
with penny farthing, probably (IMO) due to her learning it when her
brain was still recovering from the stroke.

Mom still has several cognitive issues, but she is improving in many
aspects, and where she may still be declining (and it's hard for me to
tell), she's declining slower.

Immediately after mom's stroke, I didn't know what to think would
happen to her physically or mentally.  Even a year after (only a
little more than two months ago), she was still sleeping quite a bit
and had enough mental problems that it looked like she was doomed to a
low quality of life, _at best_.  On his most recent visit, my
brother-in-law volunteered that mom has made significant gains in just
the last month.

## Gaining Fitness

Although I'm not ninety-three years old (yet) and not a woman, I
figured that mom's four control knobs were not in their ideal
configuration for her.  Even before her stroke, I had encouraged mom
to read [Eat Move
Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17465697-eat-move-sleep),
a book whose thesis is that essentially one's diet, exercise and sleep
are the three control knobs (my terminology, not the author's) that
one can turn to improve one's health.  

Someone pointed out that socialization is pretty darned important,
which I hadn't really thought much about, because I've had an active
social life the entire time I started conciously trying to improve my
own health and fitness.  However, in my mom's case, socialization was
sorely lacking since my mom stopped driving.

So, eventually I got mom into the habit of taking a morning walk, at
roughly the same time every day (before breakfast). The walk gave her
exercise, with the ability for me to adjust the length as mom's health
and fitness improved. Doing it at the same time helped her get on a
consistent evening sleep schedule and doing it before breakfast might
have contributed a minor mini boost due to fasting, but it was also a
good way to boost her appetite and keep her regular. Since I was
walking with her, it gave us time to chat, first thing in the morning,
which was a social benefit, too.

Initially, mom was skeptical of walking before breakfast, but at least
she humored me and tried it.  She figured she wouldn't have the energy
to walk, but that was not the case.  I don't think she actually goes
into fat-burning mode like I do when I get my heart rate up around 130
and keep it there for hours in a fasted state, but I also think she
has enough energy stored (e.g., glycogen) that she doesn't need
anything for walks of the distance we do.

## Adding Regimentation to Mom's Life

Setting mom's wake-up time on her iPhone to be 6:00 every day has
been, IMO, a big help.  During the colder months, we stopped doing
that and I woke her based on the outdoor temperature, letting her
sleep in when it was below 40F or so.  When the colder months roll
around again, we'll experiment with keeping her wake-up at 6:00am.
Unless mom makes a U-turn, she'll be healthier this time around and
that wake-up time will be more ingrained (although the switch off
Daylight Saving Time will be annoying to her).

Over time, with mom waking up at 6am every day, her bedtime has
naturally stabilized too, with her recently deciding that she needs to
force herself to go to bed by 9pm.  The funny thing is that although
we had already decided she needed to turn the TV off no later than
8:30 (so _I_ can sleep; I get up earlier than she does), she's now
reading a lot and that had her staying up late enough to interfere
with her morning regimen.  Her progress on reading is awesome, and
once she identified how that was interfering with her morning she
self-corrected.

Lately, we've experimented with trying to have mom eat her lunch at
11:30, which is the same time I eat it.  It is not because I think
there's something magical about 11:30 that would make it an optimal
time for her to eat, it's more of a trade-off of convenience for me
versus flexibility or even a fixed, but later (certainly not earlier)
time to eat.  

The 11:30 lunch experiment of currently has produced mixed results and
it's not clear that we'll stick with it.  The upside is that it makes
it much more convenient for me to do a second lap with mom, because I
eat at 11:30 the vast majority of days, so&mdash;depending on how mom
feels&mdash;we can either walk before her lunch or after, or perhaps
even at 11:30 itself, slipping her lunch to noon.

In addition to walking, mom does some exercises that were prescribed
by her physical therapist, but she currently tends to do them on an
ad-hoc basis.  I also want her to start doing regular "get up off the
floor" exercises, so that her muscles and brain will be better at
getting her upright should she trip.  My *guess* is eventually we'll
come up with a set time to do these other exercises so that doing them
will become second nature. However, every increase in regimentation
has been an experiment and we're only keeping what appears to work.

## Losing Regimentation in My Life



## Rhythm?

These days, I'm experimenting with eating some of my lunch while I
walking with mom on her second loop, because we have less need to talk
(having already walked together for over an hour in the morning).
