# One Year Anniversary

I wrote this page on Tuesday, June 3rd, 2025 after completing an
important urgent task for Craft Poker Co. This lets people know some
of what's been happening with my mom and me. It also documents things
that I may forget.

## How it started

Before mom had her stroke, she was having some cognitive issues that
suggested she was experiencing a slide into senility.  Her stroke had
both physical and mental manifestations, but she was so messed up that
it was hard to judge what was stroke and what was senility.

Mom came out of in-patient rehab needing many changes to her house and
a special walker that gave more stability.  Her thinking was
disorganized.  She made many sequencing errors.  By the time I moved
in with her, she had made great progress, but still was receiving
in-home physical, speech and occupational therapy.

Prior to her stroke, mom would walk a .66 mile loop and stop and rest
twice, using her walker with a built in seat.  She didn't return to
that route until I moved in with her.  I had her join Strava and [we
tried that loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/11566861975). In
[my tracks](https://www.strava.com/activities/11567461433), I can see
that we stopped at the two spots she used to stop.

I'm glad I thought to put mom on Strava, but I didn't take any baseline
measurements, per-se. However, Marcia had already started taking mom's
blood pressure every day.  I continued that policy and have dutifully
entered that data into her iPhone's health app.

I track quite a bit about myself, but much less more about mom.  One
thing I don't track for either of us, but I do pay attention to is
knee discomfort.  I've found, over the years, that when **I** have
knee discomfort, [running helps](../../running/my-beliefs/knees.md)
("motion is lotion") more often than not.  In the first few months
there times when she [TODO](https://www.strava.com/activities/13074881707)
I"M PUTTING THIS BRANCH AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE


I don't know what mom's weight was then, nor do I know what it was
now.  I do know that she was a size 14, because recently she's had to
buy new clothes due to her weight loss.

Mom was on six drugs, including baby aspirin and one that lists dementia
as a possible side-effect.  The description for that drug on a UK NHS
site says that people should be on it for as little time as possible and
that a doctor would check every six to twelve months to see if it could
be reduced. We do not live in the UK and AFAIK, nobody was checking on
her ability to reduce that drug.

In addition to taking care of mom, I now had to take care of mom's
ancient cat who needs a special diet and has to be fed several
(approximately eleven) times a day.  The cat also needs her litter box
cleaned several times a day or she will deliberately pee outside it to
make a point.

## How it's going

Mom walks more now than she has in decades.  I typically take her for
a walk in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Yesterday, June
2nd, a storm was supposed to arrive that would preclude her afternoon
walk, so&mdash;with her agreement&mdash;I took her on [her longest
walk to date](https://www.strava.com/activities/14672439777). It was
1.99 miles according to her phone and took her just under an hour and
a quarter.

The only drug mom is on now is the baby aspirin. I still don't know
how much mom weighs, but she's recently bought size 10 clothes.  Her
blood pressure graph from the last year shows a slow but steady
decrease, although the graph provided by Apple's health app isn't in
itself _super_ informative.  However, she was on meds for hypertension
_before_ her stroke and I've weaned her off them and she has a better
blood pressure than she had before her stroke when she was on them.

Each day, as I walk with mom we converse.  At certain points on our walk
I tend to ask her questions about information she's learned post-stroke.
Initially, it started with a single question, which was what is the name
for that big wheeled bicycle that I'd point to.  I had told her that it
was a penny farthing, but that didn't stick.  Often, I'd have to give
her hints.  We even looked up the definition of a farthing and she has
a niece whose name is Penny. The variance associated with her recall made
things surreal, but there was slow, but steady improvement.

It would take far too long for me to write down the memory games/tests
we play each day on our walks, but over time we went from just the
penny farthing to the name of the person who lives at the house that
has the penny farthing in the yard (it turns out to be a cousin of my
wife) to the names of a dog and the dog's owner at another place in
the walk as well as the name of her next door neighbor and his dog and
a couple different types of cactus (cholla and prickly pair).  The
interesting thing to me is she has historically had the most problem
with penny farthing, probably (IMO) due to her learning it when her
brain was still recovering from the stroke.

Mom still has several cognitive issues, but she is improving in many
aspects and where she may still be declining (and it's hard for me to
tell), she's declining slower.

Immediately after mom's stroke, I didn't know what to think would
happen to her physically or mentally.  Even a year after (only a
little more than two months ago), she was still sleeping quite a bit
and had enough mental problems that it looked like she was doomed to a
low quality of life, _at best_.  On his most recent visit, my
brother-in-law volunteered that mom has made significant gains in just
the last month.
