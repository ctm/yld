# Too Public a Life?

I'm [Cliff Matthews](https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20)

aka ctm ([GitHub](https://github.com/ctm), [Albuquerque Game

Although I don't wear a tinfoil hat, I _am_ concerned with privacy,
albeit I'm more concerned with yours than mine.

I ~~don't~~ have a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093257525075)[^1] (although not yet an Instagram) account. I also have a [LinkedIn
account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/),
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. 

Over the years, I've tossed various random stuff into [public
repositories](https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories) in my GitHub
account. In 2016 I chose to publicly document [the
training](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md)
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so this book
continues that tradition. I'll slowly added more info that people may
or may not find handy. It keeps me off the streets.

[^1]: I am exceedingly late to the Facebook game. So far I haven't deliberately
reached out and asked anyone to be my friend, although I may have been tricked
into doing so by thinking I was clicking a button or three to accept a friend
request.  _A_ problem (I won't use the definitive article, becvause I have
many problems) I have is that I love people, including people who hate me.
I don't currently have the time to ask seven billion or so people to be my
friend, so &hellip; I ask no one&mdash;for now.
