# Too Public a Life?

I'm [Cliff Matthews](https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20)
([Team RWB](https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056),

aka ctm ([GitHub](https://github.com/ctm), [Albuquerque Game

([Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/nmdeadhead/), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/nmdeadhead), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nmdeadhead)). 

Although I don't wear a tinfoil hat, I _am_ concerned with privacy,
albeit I'm more concerned with yours than mine.

I don't have a Facebook or Instagram account. I do have a [LinkedIn
account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/),
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. 

Over the years, I've tossed various random stuff into [public
repositories](https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories) in my GitHub
account. In 2016 I chose to publicly document [the
training](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md)
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so this book
continues that tradition. I'll slowly added more info that people may
or may not find handy. It keeps me off the streets.
