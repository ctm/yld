Started on July 20th, 2025.  I'll be 63 by the end of November, 2025 and
I probably won't do anything with this page, so I'm stuffing it into a branch.

Yesterday I got the news that [Valdemar DeHerrera](https://www.taosnews.com/news/wwii-vet-valdemar-deherrera-dead-at-105/article_b6a6ebff-e3ff-5152-846a-e1e473f73fab.html) had [died](https://www.devargastaos.com/obituaries/valdemar-deherrera). He was 105.

My mother is 93.

I am 62.

All three of us were 31 once.  That's how young I was when I attended my
first [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/).  Yes, I've been going to BARGE for
half my life.
