I put clothing back on after I cooled down, and I cooled down fairly quickly (around ten minutes, I think), because I ate my post-race oatmeal which had been sitting in my unheated truck and drank a bunch of rice milk, too. Today, however, I ran 5.6 miles in 54 minutes, wearing shoes, socks, running shorts and wool gloves (i.e. no shirt). It was 19.4F at the start and 22.1F at the end, but it was sunny.

It is unclear just how much of my peculiarities are genetic and how much are adaptations. Here are the three things that suggest I have some, but not super rare, advantages for running and for liking the cold:

I'm tall, so part of that is genetics (but part is also not having had nutritional or other causes of stunting my growth).

When I was in middle school, we created a crude lung volume measuring device and I "won", by being able to blow out more air (which then displaced easily measured water) than anyone else, however, I was taller than most and I went almost last, and hence knew how much I had to blow out to "win" and I'm stubborn as heck. I actually passed out while trying to get the most out. My guess is my lungs aren't particularly large for my height, although perhaps my stubborness is genetic.

When I lived in Alaska for a year(I turned five years old up there), I believeI waded in the ocean when it was too cool for most and when I was living in New Hampshire in elementary school, I liked to play in the ocean earlier in the year than most and later in the year than most, but I really enjoyed playing, so I don't know how much of that had to do with me putting up with some discomfort to get the play I wanted and how much was due to a different tolerance for coldness.

OTOH, I have actively done things designed to promote adaptations for running and liking the cold and I think they've worked, but lots of people kid themselves, so who knows.

As for protein intake, I've been keeping a fairly thorough diet log since March 31st, 2018, but only rarely did I ever try to figure out how much protein I was getting. By doing a search, I found this entry for April 30th, 2018:

==================================================
Breakfast @ 9:00
533  normal oatmeal (after 13.1 mile run w/intervals) (25g protein)
 50? 16 oz. rice milk
 50? green drink

Noon lunch
120 1/2 brick tempeh (20g protein)
900 3 cups? cooked black matpe beans (lots of water) (44g protein?)
 70 2 cups green beans

3pm snack
120 1/2 brick Tempeh (20g protein)
135 3x Halos mandarin oranges

5pm dinner
450  2 cups kidney beans (30g protein)
400? 4 cups corn, squash & zucchini (10?g protein)

160  1 oz. mixed nuts (5g protein)

~130g protein.  I probably didn't need to eat the tempeh to get the
101 grams of protein _Racing Weight_ claims a vegan athlete of my
weight needs, however today was both 13.1 miles *with* intervals and
core exercise (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 60 squats), so perhaps
having some extra isn't too bad.
==================================================

Be aware that my "normal" oatmeal is fortified with chia seeds, hemp seeds, soy milk and udo's oil.

In general, lentils and beans are my primary source of protein and when I think I need more, I supplement with either tofu, tempeh or seitan. Lately I've been buying fairly large bags of gluten and making my own homemade seitan, so I tend to turn to that first, because it's cheap (if you ignore the opportunity cost of my time spent making it).

I log a bunch of stats and when my stats dip for no obvious other reason, I look a little closer at my diet. FWIW, the calculation I did back in April 2018 from Racing Weight had me only needing 101 grams of protein, but the formula there, I think, was based on fat free weight which I had measured via hydrostatic testing at UNM. At the time, I weighed 172.5 pounds, which would be 125 grams of protein @ 1.6 grams / kg.

Getting your JD, getting married, and apparently (at least as far as I can tell from your twitter account) being happy is pretty good for someone your age (77?). Additionally, IIRC, you turned to plants due to some heart trouble and AFAICT, you've completely reversed / eliminated that. So, your research and methodology seems to work very well. I am not trying to tell you what to do. However, if you're still reading and you don't mind me asking a question, I'm curious as to why you went with 1.6 grams / kg, especially as to whether you saw any change in happiness, health or performance after doing so.
