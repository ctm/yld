<p>Greetings. I'm <a href="https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20">Cliff Matthews</a>
(<a href="https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056">Team RWB</a>,
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205">Strava</a>), aka Clifford
Matthews
(<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&amp;lname=Matthews">UltraSignup</a>),
aka deadhead (<a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>,
<a href="https://devctm.com/">devctm</a>, <a href="https://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyRaces?ManiacId=4395">Marathon
Maniacs</a>),
aka ctm (<a href="https://github.com/ctm">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game
Developers Guild</a>) aka nmdeadhead
(<a href="https://freesound.org/people/nmdeadhead/">Freesound</a>). Although I
don't wear a tinfoil hat, I <em>am</em> concerned with privacy, albeit I'm
more concerned with yours than mine.</p>
<p>I don't participate in traditional social media. I do have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/">LinkedIn
account</a>,
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. I don't
have a Facebook or Instagram account.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've tossed various random stuff into <a href="https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories">public
repositories</a> in my GitHub
account over the years. In 2016 I chose to publicly document <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md">the
training</a>
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so I've
continued that tradition and slowly added more info that people may or
may not find handy.</p>
<p>Before too long I'll be looking for investors in the company that I've
formed to monetize my poker software.  I figure investors are
potentially going to do some web sleuthing to find out more about me,
so putting a chunk of info here makes sense and it goes hand-in-hand
with doing post-running brain dumps that are kind of like a blog, but
done in mdbook (the format that this document is in).</p>
<p>Currently, on a typical week I run for a couple hours or more on
Mondays through Saturdays and ride my bike for several hours on
Sunday.  This gives me a lot of time to think and record voice notes.
I'm planning to dump some of my thoughts into this &quot;book&quot;.  It's kind
of like me writing up thoughts for a younger version of myself and
probably equally pointless.  I don't (yet!) have a time machine and
younger deadhead listened to nobody.</p>
<p>So far, I've mostly used this as a place to dump GPX files since free
Wordpress won't host them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running"><a class="header" href="#running">Running</a></h1>
<p>I run a lot. I'm also the race director for the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/">Baldy
50k</a> and the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/">Chimney
Melon
50k</a>,
which are two of the events in the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/">Albuquerque Fat Ass
Series</a>.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Fat Ass Series is hosted (for free, thanks!) on
wordpress.com and as such it can't host the GPX files that
participants might want, so I host them here.</p>
<p>On Thursday, August 12th, 2021 <a href="http://www.abqroadrunners.com/uploads/6/7/7/6/6776981/arr_newsletter_2021.august.pdf">I gave</a>,
to the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road Runners</a>, a
brief presentation on my Hardrock 2021 experience. I had planned on writing
up the notes in this book and then using them to guide my presentation,
but instead I just had a few beers and talked everyone's ears off.  So,
I have to get into Hardrock again so I can do it right next time.</p>

previous runnings of the Baldy 50k.</p>
<p>I've run Baldy 50k several times, but so far, I've only uploaded three
of them to Strava.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from reviewing my paths on Strava, none of those
three have any significant wrong turns.  The ones from 2019 and 2020
have ridiculous elevation profiles though. They were made with an
ancient Ambit 3 that just does a horrible job with elevation.</p>

<p>I'll try to get these onto webscorer, but for now, they're here.  Normally
people have to finish by 9pm for it to count, but that rule was relaxed this
year due to the excessive blowdown.</p>
<p>George and I slowed down significantly on the way out to Johnson Lake
as we did some trail maintenance. We employed all sorts of tricks
(with no injuries in this universe) to improve things: primarily
moving, breaking, bending and kicking.  However, there was still more
blowdown that we couldn't improve than the amount we did improve. So,
I doubt anyone who came after us would even notice our handiwork.</p>
<p>The weather was very nice.  No thunder or lightning or even rain. It
was mostly overcast.  My truck claims it was 42F at about 7:30am and
51F at 8:20pm.</p>
<p>The timings below are from each of the participant's Strava tracks.  I'll
ask James and Spencer if they'd prefer to tie for 3rd since they both
came in together.</p>

<p>Wordpress free hosting is an excellent service, but they don't allow
GPX files to be downloaded directly.  There are other excellent free
sites, like <a href="https://www.trailrunproject.com/">trailrunproject.com</a>
that host GPX files, but require you to create a (free) account and
log-in to download them.</p>
<p>Most people are OK with using free accounts and the tracking that comes
with them to get useful information, but some aren't.  As such, not
only do I provide GPX files for the races I direct, I will also add
GPX files for other events so that people who wish not to be tracked
can download them.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wylie_Hubbard">Ray Wylie Hubbard</a>
closes his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w">Mother
Blues</a> with the words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the days that I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations, I
have really good days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, until he distilled and articulated it, that was unconscious
knowledge.  However, now that I know the &quot;trick,&quot; I try very much to
have very good days even though I have high expectations.</p>
<p>I'm very lucky: I get the runner's high as I run, which leads itself
to a profound sense of gratitude (but not quite in a drunken
slobbering &quot;I love you man&quot; repeated ad nauseum sense).</p>
<p>This section contains entries for groups (and eventually individuals)
that I'm thankful for.  It's just shy of paralyzingly intimidating to
start writing these entries, because it's going to take a long time
and I certainly don't want any group or person to feel left out.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdg"><a class="header" href="#agdg">AGDG</a></h1>
<p>I'm new to the <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game Developers Guild</a>
but I've known one of the co-founders for years and he's one of the
friendliest people I know. Not surprisingly, the group he co-founded
is also welcoming.</p>
<p>When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so it's not like I'm just attending the meetings for the
free (virtual/remote) booze.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdgat"><a class="header" href="#agdgat">AGDGAT</a></h1>
<p>After the ADGD remote meeting finishes, a subset of members join for an
accountability meeting.  The premise is simple, each member briefly describes
the work that member did in the previous week, specifically compared to
the prediction that member made at the last meeting.  Congratulations,
sympathy, understanding and words of encouragement are provided and then
that member makes a prediction for the following week.  The predictions
are tracked on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this process, even though I've fallen short more times
than I've exceeded my goals. I miss many meetings because <a href="thanks/agdg/../team_rwb.html">Team
RWB</a> meets for Taco Tuesdays twice a month,
but that's one nice thing about weekly meetings, there's another one
next week.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="barge"><a class="header" href="#barge">BARGE</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE website</a> explains what BARGE is
better than I can.</p>
<p>I attended my first BARGE in 1994.</p>
<p>It was through BARGE that I learned about handheld GPS devices (thanks
Patti and Bingo!), which got me into hiking.</p>
<p>When I needed to have a medical procedure done in San Francisco, two
BARGErs (thanks Patti and Charles) put me up.</p>
<p>I ran my first mile (on July 22nd, 2009) in anticipation of the BARGE
Fun Run. I even wrote email to a running friend of mine and told her
that I had just run my first mile and I actually enjoyed it but that I
hadn't caught the running bug (hah!).</p>
<p>BARGE members tested multibot, my first poker server and are actively
using mb2, the poker server I wrote twenty years later.</p>
<p>I owe these people a lot!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="team-rwb"><a class="header" href="#team-rwb">Team RWB</a></h1>
<p>Team RWB is a veteran's service organization that provides
opportunities for veterans and the community to connect through
physical and social activity. I first became aware of them when I saw
people in Team RWB shirts helping a man navigate the <a href="https://bataanmarch.com/">Bataan Memorial
Death March</a> (BMDM) using a hand-cranked
vehicle to propel himself. His legs didn't function, but his arms did
and although I didn't know who they were at the time, it was clear he
had a most excellent support crew.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel room, I web searched Team RWB and learned
that they were open to civilians.  Eventually I decided to join because
my father served in the Air Force for twenty years and as an Air Force
brat I went to a few years of school on base. I figured I had a bit of
experience with the BMDM and perhaps I could help out some way.</p>
<p>Over the years our Albuquerque group has turned into a national
chapter through the great leadership of many captains. I'm lucky to
have found them and honored that they allow me to participate in their
various activities.</p>
