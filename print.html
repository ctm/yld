<p>Greetings. I'm <a href="https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20">Cliff Matthews</a>
(<a href="https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056">Team RWB</a>,
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205">Strava</a>), aka Clifford
Matthews

aka deadhead (<a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>,

aka ctm (<a href="https://github.com/ctm">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game

don't wear a tinfoil hat, I <em>am</em> concerned with privacy, albeit I'm
more concerned with yours than mine.</p>
<p>I don't participate in traditional social media. I do have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/">LinkedIn
account</a>,
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. I don't
have a Facebook or Instagram account.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've tossed various random stuff into <a href="https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories">public
repositories</a> in my GitHub
account. In 2016 I chose to publicly document <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md">the
training</a>
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so I've
continued that tradition and slowly added more info that people may or
may not find handy.</p>
<p>Before too long I'll be looking for investors in the company that I've
formed to monetize my poker software.  I figure investors are
potentially going to do some web sleuthing to find out more about me,
so putting a chunk of info here makes sense and it goes hand-in-hand
with doing post-running brain dumps that are kind of like a blog, but
done in mdbook (the format that this document is in).</p>
<p>Currently, on a typical week I run for a couple hours or more on
Mondays through Saturdays and ride my bike for several hours on
Sunday.  This gives me a lot of time to think and record voice notes.
I'm planning to dump some of my thoughts into this &quot;book&quot;.  It's kind
of like me writing up thoughts for a younger version of myself and
probably equally pointless.  I don't (yet!) have a time machine and
younger deadhead listened to nobody.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running"><a class="header" href="#running">Running</a></h1>
<p>I run a lot. I'm also the race director for the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/">Baldy
50k</a> and the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/">Chimney
Melon
50k</a>,
which are two of the events in the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/">Albuquerque Fat Ass
Series</a>.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Fat Ass Series is hosted (for free, thanks!) on
wordpress.com and as such it can't host the GPX files that
participants might want, so I host them here.</p>
<p>On Thursday, August 12th, 2021 <a href="http://www.abqroadrunners.com/uploads/6/7/7/6/6776981/arr_newsletter_2021.august.pdf">I gave</a>,
to the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road Runners</a>, a
brief presentation on my Hardrock 2021 experience. I had planned on writing
up the notes in this book and then using them to guide my presentation,
but instead I just had a few beers and talked everyone's ears off.  So,
I have to get into Hardrock again so I can do it right next time.</p>
<p>In my early ultra running years I benefited greatly from various
blogs, including, but by no means limited to, <a href="https://clydeologist.blogspot.com/">Studies in
Clydeology</a>, <a href="https://athenadiaries.blogspot.com/">The Athena
Diaries</a>, <a href="https://dreadpiraterackham.blogspot.com/">Club
Dread</a>, and <a href="https://pinkcorker.blogspot.com/">the Pink
Corker's</a>.  Often these blog writers
had done events that I was contemplating entering and their insights
helped prepare me.</p>
<p>However, I'm always doing something and if I had to write a good blog
entry for a race, I'd never finish (because I'm a bad writer, a
procrastinator and someone whose memory won't remember details when I
want to write them down and whose impatience won't write memories down
when I still have them). So, instead of a blog, I'm sort of doing a
book, and I'm using GitHub so that I can change things over time, but
not in a sneaky way to pretend I didn't say something that later turns
out embarrassing, but to allow me to eventually cut dross and provide
useful information rather than a quick brain dump.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="resources"><a class="header" href="#resources">Resources</a></h1>
<p>Exceedingly little of what I do is anything I have thought up myself.
At best, some of the things I do are a synthesis of what others do,
kind of like my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt">fortified
oatmeal</a>
being a mixture of food that I think is good for me that tastes great
when mixed together.</p>
<p>Over the years I've read many books, blog posts, and web articles as
well as simply asked questions of people with much more experience
than I.  I didn't, however, take notes on what I've read or what
people have answered, so this Resources section is going to be my
usual hodge-podge of stuff that I think of when I'm spending a few
minutes jotting things down.</p>
<h3 id="couch-to-5k"><a class="header" href="#couch-to-5k">Couch to 5k</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://marathonhandbook.com/couch-to-5k-training-plan/">Couch to 5k
program</a> is
worth mentioning even though I never did it. However, the people who
started the BARGE Fun Run did and that's what inspired them.  The
BARGE Run Run inspired me.  After seeing me finish my first marathon,
my brother-in-law thought &quot;If Cliff can do it, how hard can it be?&quot;
and decided to run a marathon as well.  He, however, on my advice, did
use the Couch to 5k program.  Not only did he finish the 2010 Chicago
Marathon, but he's gone on and done a variety of ultras, including the
Leadville Trail 100.  So, Couch to 5k is pretty worthwhile.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="books"><a class="header" href="#books">Books</a></h1>
<p>This list is currently unordered and contains no reviews.  Eventually,
I <em>might</em> explain what I think I got out of each book, but for now
this is a super quick, nowhere near exhaustive, brain dump.  In fact, I
wrote this while away from home, so I wasn't even able to glance at my
bookshelf to fill in gaps.</p>

director.  I may get better as time goes on or I may shed my RD duties.
I certainly don't want to be a race director, per-se, but I don't want

<p>I've run Baldy 50k several times, but so far, I've only uploaded three
of them to Strava.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from reviewing my paths on Strava, none of those
three have any significant wrong turns.  The ones from 2019 and 2020
have ridiculous elevation profiles though. They were made with an
ancient Ambit 3 that just does a horrible job with elevation.</p>

<p>However, I placed them here before I put them there, so I'm leaving
them here as well.  Normally people have to finish by 9pm for it to
count, but that rule was relaxed this year due to the excessive
blowdown.</p>
<p>George and I slowed down significantly on the way out to Johnson Lake
as we did some trail maintenance. We employed all sorts of tricks
(with no injuries in this universe) to improve things: primarily
moving, breaking, bending and kicking.  However, there was still more
blowdown that we couldn't improve than the amount we did improve. So,
I doubt anyone who came after us would even notice our handiwork.</p>
<p>The weather was very nice.  No thunder or lightning or even rain. It
was mostly overcast.  My truck claims it was 42F at about 7:30am and
51F at 8:20pm.</p>

<p>Over the years I've participated in more than a couple of hundred events.
I often take notes to myself before and afterward; I've even written the
occasional event report and mailed it to a few friends.  Unless asked,
I don't plan on digging up any of that old information, but I will
take a stab at documenting my experiences here.</p>
<p>So, now I'm trying to write up &quot;brief&quot; (yeah, right) summaries of the
various events I participate in as a way to (very slightly) eventually
give back to the community. I really wanted to do this after Hardrock
in preparation for my ARR presentation, but I did not allocate the
time to do so and just gave a drunken rant instead.</p>
<p>Although these reports are for me, if you have a question about
anything I've written here, <a href="mailto:clifford.t.matthews@gmail.com">send me

<p>This was the biggie, but I didn't take notes
at the time.  My excellent team comprised JE: crew chief, SB: JE's
right hand man, PL: pacer from Grouse (mile 42.2) to Telluride (mile
72.8) and MW: pacer from Telluride to the finish line.  They did all
the work. I just had to hike, walk and run in a big circle with their
assistance.</p>
<p>I will come back and fill this in sometime.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="big-cottonwood-marathon-2022"><a class="header" href="#big-cottonwood-marathon-2022">Big Cottonwood Marathon 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I had run the <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm">Big Cottonwood Marathon</a>
twice prior: <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1579538">2019</a>
and <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1792746">2021</a>.  Both
times, I raced it so I could (and did!) qualify for the Boston
Marathon. It is a very downhill course, although the rollers starting
around mile 19 have slowed me down all three years.</p>
<p>This year, however, my truck died the day before and that
complicated my race.  Luckily, I'll be sixty years old by Boston
2023, so I only needed to run a 3:50 to qualify and I ran
<a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=7660499">3:25:32</a>.</p>
<p>This report is for my own benefit.  Although I remember the details
clearly as I write this, it won't be too long before I forget many of
the details.  My plan is to switch from running the Big Cottonwood
Marathon as a Boston Qualifier to running the Tucson marathon.  My
MSCS advisor has moved to Tucson and running that race would be a good
excuse to visit him.  Additionally, Aravaipa puts on a good event.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-albuquerque-to-moab"><a class="header" href="#thursday-albuquerque-to-moab">Thursday: Albuquerque to Moab</a></h2>
<p>I left Albuquerque around the time I thought I'd need to leave in
order to arrive at <a href="https://moabkitchen.com/">Moab Kitchen</a> around
4pm, i.e., just as they were opening.  I love Moab Kitchen and I also
found a great campsite just north of there last year that I was looking
forward to returning to.</p>
<p>I did indeed get there shortly after four. I ate some food, made a
business call, caught up on my email and was about to drive to the
<a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#geminibridges">Gemini Bridges Road
campground</a>
when I remembered that the last time I had tried to use four-wheel
drive I had trouble shifting it in and out. So, instead of waiting
until I absolutely had to have 4WD, I decided to check it in the Moab
Kitchen parking lot. Uh oh. Not only was it exceedingly hard for me to
get it into 4-Low, I basically couldn't get it, unassisted, back into
2WD.</p>
<p>After texting some friends for advice, I tried rocking the truck back
and forth, and finally I got it into 2WD.  Dodged a bullet!  Gemini
Bridges was out, so I chose to go to <a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#klondikebluffs">Klondike Bluffs
Road</a>
instead. My truck sounded a little funny as I was driving, but I was
harried and there may have been grooves in the asphalt.  I couldn't
figure out if I was imagining things.</p>
<p>I set up my tent, read a bit of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29359067-presto-how-i-made-over-100-pounds-disappear-and-other-magical-tales">Presto!</a>,
then went to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork"><a class="header" href="#friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork">Friday morning: Moab to Spanish Fork</a></h2>
<p>I woke up at my normal time and kicked myself for not having joined
AAA.  My buddy Jason's truck's radiator catastrophically failed a
couple weeks prior. He had to pay a huge bill to get his truck towed.
At the time, I had mentioned that I keep meaning to sign up for AAA
(my truck is a 1998 with more than 200,000 miles on it), but I always
forget. So, although it would have been better to have signed up well
before heading out from Albuquerque, I used my phone as a hot-spot and
joined AAA.</p>
<p>The noise I thought I had heard while driving the previous night had
disappeared, or perhaps it had never been there or maybe even I had
gotten accustomed to it. Regardless, other than running way too low on
gas and having to pay around $6/gallon to get a few gallons at a
remote gas station, the drive went well until I my truck failed to
drive when the stoplight I was at turned green.</p>
<p>I was in the left-most of three non-turning lanes on highway six in
Spanish Fork.  I put my hazards on, then tried putting the truck in
neutral and pushing it out of the way.  It moved a little before it
stopped and couldn't be pushed.  Not by me solo and not when three
large men volunteered to help.  The transmission was fried and nothing
I did helped.</p>
<p>I tried to arrange a tow through AAA but their system didn't work well,
so it literally took hours while I interacted with them.  Eventually
my truck was towed to Tunex in nearby Springville.  The Tunex people
were nice and understanding, but not only did they need to diagnose
the problem, they also had to find a replacement transfer case and
drive-train so they could get me a quote.  It was not going to be
cheap, nor would it be done soon.</p>
<h2 id="friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel"><a class="header" href="#friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel">Friday afternoon: Spanish Fork to packet pickup and the hotel</a></h2>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a car in Springville that I could rent for
a day at <a href="https://turo.com/">Turo</a>.  Sometime around 5pm, I was able
to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7792735587">jog over to the rental
car</a>, drive back to
Tunex, grab a bunch of stuff from my truck (including my food; I had
chosen to drive north in a fasted state, because I figured I'd eat
in the packet pickup parking lot around noon), then drive to packet
pickup which was going to close at 7pm.</p>
<p>There was at least one accident that caused the freeway to crawl to a
halt.  I think there were actually two.  It was a bit nerve-racking
both because I needed to get to packet pickup by 7, but I certainly
didn't want to get into a fender bender.</p>
<p>I made it to packet pickup around 6pm and then got checked in to the
Residence Inn around 7pm.  I had not yet eaten that day.  I had
previously planned on what I would eat and when, but that all got
thrown out the door when my truck died. I wound up eating about <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/log/2022.txt#L10604-L10608">3,000
calories of
food</a>
(including the highish-fiber oatmeal that was supposed to be my
post-race recovery food) in an hour or so and going to bed.</p>
<h2 id="race-day-pre-race"><a class="header" href="#race-day-pre-race">Race Day, pre-race</a></h2>
<p>My alarm woke me up at 3:15 and I drank a double espresso.  I think I had
fallen asleep around 9:30, so almost six hours.  Had the previous day not
been so hectic, <em>my guess</em> is I'd have fallen asleep about an hour earlier
(and had my final calories several hours before that).</p>
<p>I had a little food at the hotel before the hotel buses drove us to the
start.  I immediately headed to the porta-potties and kept walking all
the way to the end of them and the last one was unused. Yay.</p>
<p>I put on my sweatpants and a sweatshirt and wrapped myself in the space
blanket from packet pickup.  I killed time by reading a book written by
the daughter of a Bataan Death March survivor.  Around 6:15 (I think),
I drank a double espresso. Sometime around then I also ate some basmati
rice and took two 200mg ibuprofen tablets.</p>
<p>Initially I had planned on only taking 200mg pre-race and 200mg at the
halfway point, but I had forgotten to do laundry before getting ready
to leave Albuquerque, so I didn't have a lot of clean socks.  I did,
however, have a clean pair of very thin socks.  I also didn't have any
low-mileage road shoes, so I chose the Torin pair with around 850
miles on them (as opposed to my other pair with over 1,400) and
decided the combination of ancient shoes and thin socks merited
additional analgesics.</p>
<h3 id="poor-porta-potty-position"><a class="header" href="#poor-porta-potty-position">Poor Porta-Potty Position</a></h3>
<p>The very trick that allowed me to get an open porta-potty fresh off
the bus worked against me this time.  Thinking I had plenty of time, I
got in the closest porta-potty line to where I had been sitting.  That
was the left-most line. When there is a row of N porta-potties and N
is large enough (e.g., eight or more), people at the head of any given
line then typically advance to the first of up to three porta-potties
ahead of them, specifically the one directly in front of them and one
to either side.</p>
<p>The upside of one person having the choice of three porta-potties is
that it lessens the chance of a line being completely held up by
someone taking a longer than usual time in a potty.  It does, however,
require each person at the head of the line paying attention to make
sure that each line is still moving more-or-less fairly. The downside
is that a line can stall if the person at the head of that line
doesn't understand this de facto protocol, is distracted or simply
doesn't want to take any stall except the one directly in front.</p>
<p>All else equal, the lines at either end of a row of porta-potties will
move at two-thirds the speed of the interior lines, because the person
at the head of the line will only have two porta-potties to choose
from, while the person at the head of an interior line has three.  I
knew this, but still chose to stand in the left-most line, figuring
that since I had plenty of time, two-thirds speed would get me in and
out with room to spare.  I was wrong.</p>
<p>The line I was in stalled.  I think the person at the head of the line
not only wasn't considering the diagonal stall as a possible choice, but
he also wasn't noticing that people from the adjacent line were taking
the stall in front of him repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="drawstring-disaster"><a class="header" href="#drawstring-disaster">Drawstring Disaster</a></h3>
<p>It had been cool enough that I had chosen to not take off my pre-run
outer layer, so I still had my pre-race bag with me, and the drop off
for that was back up the hill.  I decided it was more important to
pack my bag and get it dropped off and get back to the start line than
attempt to take another poop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I went to tie up my bag, the string broke.  I asked
the person shoveling bags into the truck if he had a spare bag, but he
didn't and directed me further up the hill.  I went all the way up and
nope, nobody up there had spare bags either, but there were several people
who also had broken strings.</p>
<p>I extracted the two pieces of string from the drawstring portion of the bag,
tied them together and then asked a woman for assistance.  She offered to
tie my bag while I held it, but I politely asked her to hold the bag while
I tied it so that if it came undone and I lost anything (and my phone and
wallet were in the bag!), I'd only have myself to blame.</p>
<p>I then descended to the bag-drop truck and handed them my bag and found my
place in line. With little fanfare, the race started at 6:45.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-itself"><a class="header" href="#the-race-itself">The Race itself</a></h2>
<p>Waiting in line for the race to start I was a little concerned by the
possibility of my bag either opening and disgorging some of its
contents or losing the tie that had my bib number.</p>
<p>If the bag was intact, but without a bib number, would I be able to
find it? Probably; they'd presumably set it aside and I could identify
it, or perhaps they'd open it and find my wallet. Similarly, if my
wallet or phone slipped out, I'd probably be able to reclaim them,
too.</p>
<p>Before the race started I felt like I probably <em>could</em> poop if given
the chance, but I didn't feel like I <em>needed</em> to.</p>
<p>Once I crossed the starting line, all my anxiety disappeared.  The
initial downhill grade is steep enough that it takes me a little
effort and concentration to adjust my cadence and stride so I'm
getting the &quot;free downhill&quot;, not fighting it, but also not running out
of control.</p>
<p>Before the race had begun, I was chatting with another runner and he
mentioned that the aid stations would have gels.  With that in mind, I
lightened my expandable waistband by removing five of the seven gels I
had, figuring I'd just take them from the aid station. I think that
was the right thing to do, but it did mean that my gel consumption was
less predictable, because not all aid stations. I would have known
that had I researched it pre-race, since it was <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/info#aid">well
documented</a> on the Big
Cottonwood Marathon website.</p>
<h3 id="bam"><a class="header" href="#bam">Bam!</a></h3>
<p>About nineteen miles in, I knew I had to take a porta-potty break to
poop. As I feared, eating as much as I did the prior evening caught up
with me. I was in and out fairly quickly, but a bit distracted as I
tried to tie my running short drawstring as I ran.  I was still
running a little to the right (i.e., where the porta-potties had been)
of the road when I tripped and hit fairly hard.</p>
<p>My left knee took the brunt of the impact, but I also managed to
scrape my right knee and bloody my right palm. I was able to get back
up almost immediately and resume running.  I had taken an additional
400mg of ibuprofen at mile 13 and by now it was kicking in, so I
didn't have that much discomfort and didn't limp, per-se, but my gait
was slightly affected.</p>
<h2 id="excuses-excuses"><a class="header" href="#excuses-excuses">Excuses, excuses</a></h2>
<p>This year I was three minutes and sixteen seconds slower than last
year, but my average heart rate was ten beats per minute slower.  I
think that had I been able to eat on the day before like I had planned
and gotten to sleep when I planned, I wouldn't have needed the
porta-potty. I also think that I slowed a little before I resigned
myself to making that stop and I suspect that had I not made the
porta-potty stop I wouldn't have fallen.</p>
<p>So, did my truck's death the day before prevent me from PR'ing? Maybe.
On the other hand, it took me 1:29:50 to get to mile 12 this year and
only 1:28:08 to get there the year before.  Mile 12 was long before I
took the porta-potty break, so presumably I wasn't slowed as much by
GI distress and definitely wasn't slowed by the fall (that hadn't yet
occurred) in my first 12 miles.  On the other hand, last year my heart-rate
was around 150bpm at mile 12, but only around 135bpn at mile 12.  My
average HR was still around 150bpm on my 24th mile last year, but had only
crept up to 140bpm by during my 24th mile this year. I believe my HR data
suggests I was being held back a bit at the end, but I'll never know.</p>
<p>FWIW, had I finished fifteen seconds earlier, I'd have been 3rd in my age
group. I'd need to take off an <em>additional</em> five minutes and seventeen
seconds to have taken 2nd AG and another six seconds after that to have
been first in my age group this year. No truck problems probably would
have given me 3rd AG. I think 2nd or 1st AG would have been a coin-flip.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath"><a class="header" href="#aftermath">Aftermath</a></h2>
<p>The injury to my left knee was minor, but sufficiently uncomfortable
that I used ibuprofen for several days after the fall.  I fell on
September 10th and the last time I used ibuprofen for my knee was
midnight between the 16th and 17th.  The scab on my knee finally came
off on October 13th, almost five weeks after the fall.  Normally my
scabs go away in two weeks.</p>
<p>Luckily, it was an injury to the outside of my knee and not anything
internal to my knee itself.  Although I didn't do a big hike a week
after the Big Cottonwood Marathon due to being stuck in Utah, I did do
the AA50k 13 days after and the Tour of the Rio Grande 15 days after.</p>
<p>I have added this aftermath section so that if I ever review this
report, it'll remind me to not fall on asphalt, especially when
accelerating in a road marathon.  It could have been <em>much</em> worse.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aa-50k-2022"><a class="header" href="#aa-50k-2022"><a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/">AA 50k</a> 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/">AA 50k</a> is a night race
(starting at 7pm on a Friday) that normally consists of up to ten 3.3
mile loops around Albuquerque Academy.  It is open to people who wish
to do fewer. Back when we had thirty or so people starting, after
people had finished they'd be put in the division for the number of
laps they had completed and then, within that division, ranked based
on their finishing time.</p>
<p>It may be time to retire this race. We only had three starters: Jason Romero,
Mark Werkmeister and myself. Jason and I finished 31 miles seconds less
than eight hours.</p>
<h2 id="the-race"><a class="header" href="#the-race">The &quot;Race&quot;</a></h2>
<p>Mark was planning on doing <em>at most</em> four laps (i.e., a half
marathon), but complication from his recent surgery limited his
participation to a little more than two laps (a bit more than a 10k).
Furthermore, Mark has not yet been cleared to run, so he was walking,
so Jason, Mark and I walked together initially.</p>
<p>About four tenths of a mile into his third loop, Mark let prudence 
turn him back toward his car so he could drive home. Although he had
been cleared by his doctor to walk and hike, his body was acting up
and telling him to stop. He listened.</p>
<p>Being lazy, Jason and I accompanied Mark back to his car before restarting
our third loop.  You might think that would have caused us to do an extra
eight tenths of a mile, but instead we decided to do only nine complete
laps, since with all the futzing around, we were at 31.03 miles by then.</p>
<p>Although we stuck together, my GPS watch said my time was
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7857963617">7:59:45</a>, whereas
Jason's said his time was 7:59:47, so I stole the win!</p>
<h2 id="what-was-i-doing"><a class="header" href="#what-was-i-doing">What was I doing?</a></h2>
<p>I took this event for granted.  I knew Mark was going to be there and was
going to be walking a few loops. I also knew that earlier in the year I had
run the Cedro Peak 50k in a fasted state until the final three aid stations,
where I had a beer at each. So, I figured I could just show up, walk a few
laps with Mark, not pay much attention to my caloric intake and then run
the remaining laps after Mark was done and call it a night.</p>
<p>Turns out, Mark walks much faster than I do. He always has.  He is
taller that I am, but I suspect his natural stride is a greater
percentage of his height than mine, so at what appeared to be the same
cadence, it was hard for me to keep up without running, but my pride
didn't want me to run. I did, however want to stay near him, in order
to make chatting easier, so for the first lap and change I walked
faster than was comfortable and found myself getting tired and hungry!</p>
<p>It was a bit demoralizing to be tired and hungry after a lap and a
half when I thought I was going to breeze through the first few laps,
but the tiredness was not muscular tiredness, it was a combination of
sleepy tiredness and my body saying &quot;why are you walking at an
unnaturally fast pace when you could be running?&quot;  My guess is the
hunger was because I wasn't exerting myself enough to get my body
burning fat.</p>
<p>At some point, and I think it was after our second lap, I drank one of
my emergency double espressos.  I also ate a big hunk of (perhaps
slightly spoiled) sweet potato.  When Mark called it an early night,
my mental focus turned to his situation and even though I knew he
wasn't having an emergency, I was still hit hard by the fact that his
body was mean enough to make him quit so early.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-two-of-us"><a class="header" href="#just-the-two-of-us">Just the two of us</a></h2>
<p>Before too long, Jason and I fell into hundred-miler mode where we were
hiking the uphill leg of the loop and running the downhill leg and the
two relatively neutral legs.</p>
<p>I wound up with some GI distress both from a combination of what I had
eaten earlier in the day and <em>perhaps</em> the state of the sweet potato.
I had brought a &quot;bucket potty&quot; and kept planning on using it, but I really
didn't want to and my urge to go would disappear as I was hiking and the
bucket potty was where our cars were and we typically hiked that section.</p>
<p>By the time we had finished our sixth lap it was clear that we'd only
need to do nine complete laps this year, so I gave myself something to
look forward to at the end of each of the remaining laps: I was going
to attempt to use to bucket potty at the end of the seventh; I was
going to drink a beer at the end of the eighth and the end of the
ninth would be the finish, which would allow me to drive home where I
had a real toilet and more beer!</p>

<p>It was great to see Mark.  It's always good to see Jason too, but we
had spent a fair amount of time together two weeks prior when I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7717983430">paced
him the last 50 miles</a>
of the <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=89185#id437178">Creede
100</a>.
I hadn't seen Mark since before his operation, when he, Jason and I
did a &quot;<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7595451430">shortest double
crossing</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="aa-50k-origin"><a class="header" href="#aa-50k-origin">AA 50k Origin</a></h2>
<p>AA 50k was added to the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/">Albuquerque Fat Ass
series</a> in 2012 to give people
training for their first hundred miler a chance to run in the dark on
a familiar, accessible, tame, course.</p>
<h2 id="aa-50k-future"><a class="header" href="#aa-50k-future">AA 50k Future</a></h2>
<p>There's no longer a <em>need</em> for AA 50k, so perhaps 2022 was its final
year.  The people for whom AA 50k was initially set up for now have a
decade of night running experience.  However, hundred milers continue
to gain popularity and there's a new stable of runners who might want
the stepping stone that AA 50k can provide.  If it is to be put on in
2023, a date will be chosen much
earlier and more will be done to increase attendance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tour-of-the-rio-grande-2022"><a class="header" href="#tour-of-the-rio-grande-2022">Tour of the Rio Grande 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.torgbc.com/">Tour of the Rio Grande</a> is a bicycle event
that offers many different ride distances.  I chose to ride the
Century (100 miles). I had done this event in 2019 and wanted to do it
again, but it wasn't offered in 2020 and although it reappeared in
2021, it escaped my notice.  As centuries go, it's fairly easy in that
there's very little elevation change, but it's well done and is
surprisingly social considering the fact that they don't have a
post-ride beer garden.</p>
<p>It's not a race and—<em>temporarily</em>—being short of cash, I
chose to use the rest stop food rather than use Tailwind in my water
bottles.  That meant I stopped five times.  I'm also a big baby when
it comes to traffic, so I took a lot more time
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7867294235">6:49:23</a>) to finish
this supported 100 mile ride than I did on my last unsupported rest
day 100 miler
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7298799302">6:07:31</a>).</p>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>I chose to ride ToRG for a few reasons. </p>
<p>One is that my brother-in-law has gotten into biking and he and I were
going to ride some centuries this year, but he got injured. So,
although our centuries together are deferred to next year, I was
already looking forward to &quot;them&quot;.  In reality, although <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7187704802">I
rode</a> the <a href="https://www.santafecentury.com/">Santa Fe
Century</a> earlier this year, I
probably won't be riding the <a href="https://dayofthetread.com/">Day of the
Tread</a> Century a month from now, because
it conflicts with the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road
Runners</a> &quot;<a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/forever-young-run.html">Forever
Young</a>&quot;
footrace.</p>
<p>Two, in theory, I run six days week and ride my bike on Sundays.  In
reality, I often skip the bike ride because I'm a fair weather rider,
especially after going over the handlebars due to me overly applying
the break when coming up on black ice.  Today, however, was good weather,
so sure!</p>
<p>Three, I plan on running the Tortugas Mountain 24 hour race in Las
Cruces on a Friday evening before returning to Albuquerque and then
being the five hour pace group leader for the Duke City Marathon on
the following Sunday, so by &quot;running&quot; (cough!) the AA 50k on Friday
evening and then riding the Tour of the Rio Grande the following
Sunday, I was able to make sure that the timing worked.</p>
<h2 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h2>
<h3 id="off-course-briefly"><a class="header" href="#off-course-briefly">Off course briefly</a></h3>
<p>Before the tour started, I ran into my friend Bill Dyea from search
and rescue.  We chatted a bit which was nice, but perhaps I should
have used a little of that time to review the cue sheet, because I did
miss one turn, the one going back east on Rio Bravo.</p>
<p>When I got to that intersection, I thought I was supposed to turn, but
I looked carefully and didn't see any signs.  Perhaps there was no
sign, because the turn is &quot;obvious&quot;, but I wasn't sure if there was a
&quot;backdoor&quot; route that avoided Rio Bravo in the early afternoon when it
was really busy.  It's also possible that there had been a sign and it
was removed or that it was still there and I just didn't look in the
right place.</p>
<p>So, without seeing a sign and having a green light, I crossed Rio
Bravo. But shortly after getting to the other side I stopped, got my
bicycle out of traffic, turned on my phone, brought the course up on
Gaia, saw that I made a mistake, then backtracked back to Rio Bravo
and got back on course.</p>
<h3 id="trains-werent-bad-this-year"><a class="header" href="#trains-werent-bad-this-year">Trains weren't bad this year</a></h3>
<p>Unlike three years ago, I only had to wait briefly at a train track crossing.
There was indeed a train on the rails when I got to the infamous crossing,
but it was a relatively short train and half of it had already passed.</p>
<h3 id="roadkill-was"><a class="header" href="#roadkill-was">Roadkill was</a></h3>
<p>There was a ton of roadkill out.  I must have seen at least a half
dozen dead raccoons, two or three skunks, a couple of dead porcupines
and even a coyote.  Although I don't recall seeing as much roadkill
three years ago, two data points isn't enough to draw any conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked"><a class="header" href="#signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked">Signs definitely could be overlooked</a></h3>
<p>Other than perhaps a sign marking the Rio Bravo turn, I didn't miss
any signs that marked the course, but many people did miss the turn
for the first aid station.  That aid station is at the Las Lunas
Railrunner (the local &quot;commuter&quot; train) station, but you have to take
a left turn (on the way out) to get there.  It's at about mile
nineteen, but luckily (for the people who missed it), the second aid
station is at about mile 31.</p>
<h3 id="bad-drunk-driver"><a class="header" href="#bad-drunk-driver">Bad (drunk?) Driver</a></h3>
<p>As I was north riding on Isleta and approaching Gun Club, I saw a driver
turn left from Gun Club and swing so far into the bike lane that his tires
were inches from hitting the curb.  The driver then overcompensated and
swung past the left boundary of the lane before eventually settling into
the middle.  I was in no danger of being hit, because I was well behind,
and I doubt that the driver would have swung that wide had I been in the
way, because a bicyclist is larger than a curb, but … drivers still
scare me.</p>
<h3 id="too-much-caffeine"><a class="header" href="#too-much-caffeine">Too much caffeine</a></h3>
<p>Knowing that I was going to be stopping at all the aid stations and
that traffic (potentially including a train) might also slow me down,
I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to finish the ride in
the allotted seven hours, so … I drank a quad espresso just
before starting and another quad espresso at mile 50.  Perhaps that
was not a good choice, because I'm going to have a fair amount of
trouble sleeping at my normal time tonight.</p>
<h3 id="knee-held-up-nicely"><a class="header" href="#knee-held-up-nicely">Knee held up nicely</a></h3>
<p>I had injured my left knee when I fell at the Big Cottonwood Marathon
fifteen days ago.  My knee didn't give me any trouble at the AA 50k
Friday evening and it didn't give me any trouble on this century.
However, <em>right now</em> about seven hours after finishing, my knee is
complaining.</p>
<h3 id="music-as-a-crutch"><a class="header" href="#music-as-a-crutch">Music as a crutch</a></h3>
<p>ToRG doesn't allow people to ride with earbuds.  I don't think I'd
have used them even if I were allowed, because there's enough traffic
that I <em>really</em> want to be able to hear the cars behind me.  However,
this ride did suggest to me that I rely on the beat of music to speed
me up.  In the future, I should take that into consideration.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-mt-taylor-50k"><a class="header" href="#history-of-the-mt-taylor-50k">History of the Mt. Taylor 50k</a></h2>
<p>In 1983, Mark Lautman and Klaus Weber came up with the idea of the
Mt. Taylor Winter Quadrathlon and by 1984 it was a reality. It's been
drawing athletes to Grants ever since.</p>
<p>Kurt, one of the original co-founders of the Albuquerque Road Runners,
Ken and Margaret liked the area and wanted to introduce it to
Albuquerque's trail runners.  They came up with an awesome course and
the inaugural running even included Klaus.  The winner was Shaun Martin,
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0Wl3K-kac">Racing the Rez</a> and <a href="https://3100film.com/">3100: Run and Become</a>).</p>
<p>Shaun was also the guest speaker at that inaugural run.  He mentioned
&quot;Greeting the Sunrise&quot;: running toward the east early in the
morning. The Race Directors were already aware of that practice and
deliberately chose the starting time to be just before daybreak so the
participants could all be running toward the east as the sun rises.</p>
<h2 id="tenth-quasi-eleventh-running"><a class="header" href="#tenth-quasi-eleventh-running">Tenth (quasi eleventh) Running</a></h2>
<p>This was the tenth edition. Other than 2020, it's been an annual
event. There was no formal Mt. Taylor 50k in 2020 due to covid, but
the first dozen or so miles of the course were marked with flour so
that people who wanted to could come out and run the course on their
own if they so chose.</p>
<p>Six lucky runners, myself included, have been able to finish all ten.</p>
<h2 id="my-race"><a class="header" href="#my-race">My Race</a></h2>
<p>My goal was to experience beauty, have fun, <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=91682#id220546">finish</a> and watch others
finish. I was successful.</p>
<p>This write-up is primarily to remind me of what I did and what worked
and what failed.  It does not go into the beauty of the course or even
discuss any of the terrain or features.  There are excellent race
reports for this race out there (and maybe I'll take the time to dig
up some links after I finish my memory dump).</p>
<h3 id="camping"><a class="header" href="#camping">Camping</a></h3>
<p>There are plenty of good places to camp before the race. Jeff, my
brother-in-law, and I have been camping in the same place for the last
few years.  Were it not for the <a href="https://balloonfiesta.com/">Albuquerque International Balloon
Fiesta</a>, I'd have camped at least two
nights and probably three. However, I've been crewing for the same
balloon pilot for far longer than I've been a runner, so Friday morning
I helped with the balloon before driving over to Grants. Saturday,
after helping tear-down, I drove home so I could get up Sunday and
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7899686153">run down to the field</a>.</p>
<p>I got to Grants before packet-pickup opened, so I asked if there were
any chores I could do. Kim suggested I help unpack the shirts. I did
so, but very inefficiently. I wasn't even a quarter of the way done
with the men's shirts by the time Kim was done with the women's and
she started much later than I did.</p>
<p>It was good to see Lynette and Kathy who were doing serious
volunteering.  I hung around a little longer and saw some of the early
packet picker-uppers, then drove to my campsite, set my tent up and
walked up to the start/finish area to see if the permanent toilet had
been decorated yet (it hadn't). I meandered through another set of
campsites on my way back down to my tent.</p>
<p>Jeff had arrived. After he set up his tent, he shared two very nice
beers with me and let me help myself to the homemade hummus my sister
Marcia had made.  I kept going back for more, each time using a single
small slice of pita to scoop up a huge glob of hummus.</p>
<p>We were bedazzled by some lights strung on the other side of the dirt
road.  Upon investigation, it was Elisha and his support group.  He
was going to accompany his wife in the race the following day.  I met
Elisha through Spencer and would see Spencer the following day since
he was doing quite a bit of volunteering.</p>
<h3 id="pre-race"><a class="header" href="#pre-race">Pre-race</a></h3>
<p>I slept reasonably well in my tent.  My sleeping pad had a seam come
loose which create an awkward bump, but that only woke me up a few
times.  I also woke up a few times to empty my bladder. Sometime
between 4am and 5am I got up and used the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/207963/reliance-luggable-loo-portable-toilet-with-rope-handle">Luggable
Loo</a>
I had brought.</p>
<p>At 4:30 I had a single serving of my fortified (with hemp, chia, Udo's
oil and soy milk) oatmeal. At 5:15 I had my &quot;wake-up&quot; double espresso
and at 5:30 I had a large cup of cold coffee I had brought from
Michael Thomas.</p>
<p>I made my way to the start line wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt.  I
got a chance to chat briefly with a ton of people.  Around 6:30 I took
off my sweats.  I was wearing a headlamp, sunglasses on my head, some
running shorts, my GPS watch, socks, shoes and custom orthotics.  I
did not wear a shirt, vest or carry a water bottle, but I did have a
collapsible cup and some gels in the zippered compartment in my
shorts.</p>
<h3 id="first-loop"><a class="header" href="#first-loop">First Loop</a></h3>
<p>I remembered to drop my headlamp when I got to the collection bin.  I had
labeled it with my bib number back in Albuquerque. Yay! I've forgotten to
drop it off previously and also remembered to drop it off but forgotten to
label it previously.</p>
<p>Somewhere there was a chance for me to get water, and I did so using
my collapsible cup. Before getting to Spud Patch I ate four (100
calorie) gels.</p>
<h4 id="spud-patch"><a class="header" href="#spud-patch">Spud Patch</a></h4>
<p>There was frost on the ground at spud patch. I was still plenty warm
without my shirt.  I believe I ate two Oreos, an oatmeal cookie (which
may not have been vegan) and some pretzels and drank a cupful of
Tailwind and two cupfuls of water.</p>
<p>I almost made it back to Rock Tank without tripping. I was so close
that I had already patted myself on the back for doing so when ... I
caught my foot and hit the ground. Luckily, it was my right knee,
because my left knee was still tender (and still scabbed over) from my
fall at the Big Cotton Marathon.</p>
<h4 id="rock-tank"><a class="header" href="#rock-tank">Rock Tank</a></h4>
<p>I had planned on wearing my ultra vest at Rock Tank, but I also had two
handhelds in my drop bag &quot;just in case&quot;.  I chose to just take one handheld
with me.</p>
<p>I ate a handful of gummy candies, and maybe a banana.  I took a
handful of pretzels with me.  This may have been the fastest I've
gotten out of Rock Tank and it would have been ever so slightly faster
if my handheld had been pre-filled with water.</p>
<h3 id="second-loop"><a class="header" href="#second-loop">Second Loop</a></h3>
<p>I did fall enough for my hand to hit the ground once or twice after
Rock Tank and before Gooseberry, but neither knee hit.</p>
<p>At one point a silver haired man started running next to me and I
guessed it was
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Senovio&amp;lname=Torres">Senovio</a>.
He's nine years older than me but plenty faster. I jokingly like to
&quot;beat the old people&quot;, meaning finish faster than anyone my age or
older, but that doesn't happen when Senovio is entered.</p>
<p>I chatted with Senovio a bit and brought up his daughter, because I
knew he was proud that she finally beat him.  Eventually, <em>everyone</em>
slows down as they age, so a parent who has a running child will
eventually be overtaken. It's a day I look forward to. Unfortunately,
his daughter had some surgery that prevented her from being at
Mt. Taylor.</p>
<p>Senovio was already running faster than I wanted to run, so after paying my
respects, I slowed down and he ran out of earshot.</p>
<h4 id="gooseberry"><a class="header" href="#gooseberry">Gooseberry</a></h4>
<p>When I got to the Gooseberry aid station, Senovio was just about to
leave.  At that point I knew I was running too quickly and I also
didn't want my competitive nature kicking in, because Senovio would be
me regardless and I'd simply beat myself up trying to keep up with
him, so I had a <a href="https://santafebrewing.com/beer/oktoberfest/">beer</a>
and a <a href="https://www.fireballwhisky.com/">shot</a> instead.  Sure enough,
that tamped my competitive spirit.</p>
<p>During the ascent to the peak, I looked at my heart-rate and saw that
it was around 120.  In general, 130 or below I label as &quot;leisurely&quot;,
because I can run at that heart rate for hours and hours and not get
beaten up too badly.  As such, I felt a little bad that I wasn't
moving quickly enough to be at 130, but I had a pretty good buzz and
figured I had run my heart a bit faster on the first loop, so I
continued my upward plod.</p>
<p>On my descent from the peak I slipped on a tuft of grass and slid
downhill a little bit.  I don't think it was from the drinking, seeing
how I had fallen and hit the ground a couple times earlier when I was
sober.</p>
<h4 id="water-canyon"><a class="header" href="#water-canyon">Water Canyon</a></h4>
<p>I got into the Water Canyon aid station and asked how far Barry was in
front of me.  &quot;What's his number?&quot; &quot;I don't know&quot; &quot;We can't look him
up without his number&quot; &quot;OK&quot;.  Of the six people who had run the previous
nine Mt. Taylor 50ks, Barry is the fastest. I was curious as to whether
he was an hour ahead of me or just a few minutes.</p>
<p>I chose not to have any more alcohol, because I was still buzzed.  I
saw some small tubs of guacamole and ate two before I saw that there
was half an avocado available, so I ate that too, grabbed a handful of
peanut butter pretzels and headed down.</p>
<h4 id="water-canyon-again"><a class="header" href="#water-canyon-again">Water Canyon Again</a></h4>
<p>The hike back out of Water Canyon was sobering.  Literally. so, when I
got back to the Water Canyon aid station for the second time, I did
have another <a href="https://www.gooseisland.com/goose-ipa">beer</a>.  This time
I only had half so someone else could have the other half.</p>
<p>Fairly close to the finish I asked Jeanne if she knew where Barry was
&quot;He's in back of you?&quot; &quot;Are you sure?&quot; that was a foolish question,
but I didn't know that he too had chosen to run this event much slower
than he could.</p>
<h3 id="finish"><a class="header" href="#finish">Finish</a></h3>
<p>As I approached the finish, I remembered the year when I tripped and
fell with less than a quarter of a mile to go.  I remembered the first
year when the finish line seemed to never come.  I remembered the time
Jeff and I trained on Mt. Taylor and ran the second lap in reverse.
I was excited to finish for the tenth time.  I briefly wondered where
the years went, but soon I was with fellow finishers, the organizers
and volunteers.  I was home.</p>
<h3 id="post-race"><a class="header" href="#post-race">Post Race</a></h3>
<p>As always, the post-race celebration was festive.  There were
many stories to hear and people to cheer on.  I had initially planned
on heading home early since I had balloon crewing the following day,
but that would have meant not seeing Crystal finish. In retrospect, I
can't even believe I had even thought about leaving before helping
tear down.</p>
<p>I drove back to Albuquerque with the bed of my truck filled with garbage
bags and my head filled with inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="the-future"><a class="header" href="#the-future">The Future</a></h2>
<p>The Mt. Taylor 50k will cease to exist if substantial volunteers don't
step up. I am hoping I can do more for the race in the future, but it
will be a relatively insignificant role.  Between Craft Poker Co. and
search-and-rescue (from which I'm currently on hiatus until
<a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a> launches) I will not have
time to do any serious organization, planning or management.  Trail
Marking and/or volunteering are more likely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="feral-hog-50k-rucksack-2022"><a class="header" href="#feral-hog-50k-rucksack-2022">Feral Hog 50k Rucksack 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview-4"><a class="header" href="#overview-4">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I was the only rucker, so I finished first and DFL. My official time was
<a href="https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=293591&amp;did=350019&amp;cid=1738637&amp;gender=M">7:39:12.6</a></p>
<h2 id="why-1"><a class="header" href="#why-1">Why?</a></h2>
<p>I normally don't like to do events during Balloon Fiesta. I make an exception
for the Mt. Taylor 50k (this year, 2016) and once for Canyon de Chelly (2014),
but my plan is to do some serious ruck racing after I turn 60 and I decided
this would be a good training.</p>
<p>In fact, I thought that having an actual race hanging over my head
would keep me from drinking too much alcohol and eating too much junk
food during Balloon Fiesta (unlike last year).  That most definitely
didn't happen. Race day came with me hoping there wouldn't be any
serious competition so I would not have to push myself.</p>
<p>Turns out, there were no other ruckers, so all I had to do was finish before
the cutoff to get first place, although if I finished within nine hours
(according to the website) or eight hours (the time limit I was told when
I had five miles to go) I'd get a Feral Flask.</p>
<h2 id="reprieve"><a class="header" href="#reprieve">Reprieve?</a></h2>
<p>On Wednesday, three days before the race, Mary and Mike (the race directors)
sent an email with the subject</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trails Currently Un-runnable - Warning Order for Possible Race Cancellation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It explained that there has been an unseasonably large amount of rain and
that the trail couldn't safely be marked.  Knowing that the weather forecast
was for more rain, I thought it would be canceled, and I ate and drink on
Wednesday as if I had dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>However Thursday morning we were updated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feral Hog is a go!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What wound up happening was a compromise.  The first half of the 25k
was substituted for the second half of the 50k.  This may have made
the course a little tougher, because the second half had less
elevation change, I think.</p>
<h2 id="team-rwb"><a class="header" href="#team-rwb">Team RWB</a></h2>
<p>Three fellow Team RWB members (Roleen, Rhoda and Brianna) were
volunteering and one was running the 25k (Kathy).  I haven't done
much with Team RWB lately, so that made seeing them especially
sentimental.</p>
<h2 id="rain"><a class="header" href="#rain">Rain</a></h2>
<p>It did indeed rain all day, although there was never a downpour.  At it's
lightest it was basically a mist.  At its heaviest it was constant, but not
pelting.  I heard thunder only once and never saw lightning.</p>
<p>The rain did necessitate me running with the rain-cover on my pack.
That made access to my pack's contents sufficiently awkward that I
only got into it once, at the halfway point.  I had a temperature
sensitive toothache and the hot miso I was drinking was irritating it.
To get to my ibuprofen I had to untie my belt, take the pack off, set
it somewhere stable, remove a couple straps that held the rain-cover
on, and unzip a side pocket.  The &quot;somewhere stable&quot; is a little
tricky, because even though the pack itself only weighed a little more
than twenty pounds, that could have been enough to push over one of
the lightweight poles holding up the canopy over the smaller aid
station.</p>
<p>So, the rain was annoying in and of itself, however…</p>
<h2 id="mud"><a class="header" href="#mud">Mud</a></h2>
<p>The mud was worse than the rain.  Some of the mud was caliche, which can be
super slippery and can also stick to shoes, adding weight and weird padding.
This race was one of the few times I half-heartedly wished I had a video
camera recording some of the terrain.  It was nuts.</p>
<p>Since there was little time pressure on me, I slowed down quite a bit
anywhere the footing was dicey.  I still managed to fall in the mud
once, when I simply underestimated the slope and slipperiness of my
path.  Sure enough, I wound up with some caliche mud stuck to my leg
for the rest of the race (and the drive home).</p>
<h2 id="chafing"><a class="header" href="#chafing">Chafing</a></h2>
<p>I normally wear two panty liners on my back when rucking at speed.
These both lessen the chafing and suck up extra blood from chafing.
However, when training I put them on using a mirror and at the Bataan
Memorial Death March I have someone else apply them.  For this event,
I did it myself, without a mirror and may not have gotten one of them
positioned where it would do the most good.</p>
<p>I also had to take my pack off at an aid station so it could be
weighed.  I'm pretty sure one of my pads shifted when I did that,
because I did get enough chafing afterward to slow me down.  It's not
excruciating to have a pack sliding up and down on raw flesh, but it
something I feel with each step and the faster I run the more I feel
it, so there were sections of the course in the second half where I
could have run faster but chose not to.</p>
<h2 id="too-much-salt"><a class="header" href="#too-much-salt">Too Much Salt?</a></h2>
<p>There was plenty for me to eat, and each aid station had hot miso.  It
was about fifty degrees Fahrenheit and raining, so I had plenty of
miso at each stop. I don't know why, but pretzels were especially
appealing to me, so each time I left an aid station I grabbed a
handful of them.</p>
<p>As the event progressed, my fingers, and later my hands, started
swelling.  At the end, when the race directors were considering
throwing out the remaining miso, I volunteered to drink the amount my
finisher's cup would hold.  By then my swelling was pronounced, but I
knew I had peed regularly and figured that I'd pee even more since I
also had a beer and twenty-four ounces of rice milk.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have had significant swelling in a long time.
I assume it was from all the salt I was consuming.  I don't normally
take salt supplements, although I often drink some Tailwind as I run.
Lately I've been too broke to keep buying Tailwind and this course had
free Heed, but I don't like heed, so most of my liquid was miso, and
the liquid in pickles.  I started with about fifty ounces of water in
my bladder, but only drank about ten ounces of it; I wasn't sweating
much considering my slow pace, relatively lightweight pack and the
constant cool rain.</p>
<p>Other than the swelling, I had no discomfort and although I was going
slowly due to chafing and mud, I was not sluggish.  So I don't think I
had hyponatremia or kidney or liver trouble.  The fact that the
swelling decreased steadily after the race was over reinforces my
belief that I wasn't at risk of injury due to the swelling, but it is
something I would have been concerned with if were only a quarter of
the way done with my race when my hands were as big as they were.
It's definitely something for me to watch in the future.</p>

<p>My hat is off to Mary and Mike.  They put on an excellent event with
very uncooperative weather.  Presumably it would have been much easier
for them to simply cancel than to do the reroute.  I am glad that they
didn't.  Race Directing is a hard work.  Putting on a race in New
Mexico immediately adjacent to the Mt. Taylor 50k has to be tough.  I
applaud the addition of this race to our locale.</p>

<p>I do not know the area, but Wikipedia shows Batavia's elevation as 594

river crossings, and 1,618 feet of gain in the first 20.31 miles, so
the Ohio course <em>appears</em> to be comparable to the New Mexico one (Ohio
having more water crosings, New Mexico being at a higher altitude).</p>

<h2 id="overview-5"><a class="header" href="#overview-5">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I completed fourteen loops: four before sleeping, ten after.  I was in
the open division, not the drinking division, but I did drink a bit.
Several people finished with more loops than I did, but I needed to be
very conservative so that I could return to Albuquerque (a three and
half hour drive) after the awards ceremony in order to be the five
hour pace group leader for the Duke City marathon.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race-1"><a class="header" href="#pre-race-1">Pre-Race</a></h2>
<p>The day before the race, I borrowed $100 from my son for gas money.  I
didn't think that would be enough for all the gas I would consume, but
I still had some cash in my wallet and a tiny bit in the bank which I
could use via my debit card.</p>
<p>On race day, I woke up and went to make my wife a cappuccino only to
realize we were out of espresso beans.  Oops!  We had been using
fairly scruffy beans of late, so I chose to drive down to <a href="https://www.michaelthomascoffee.com/">Michael
Thomas</a> and get some <strong>excellent</strong>
beans. I knew the expenditure <em>might</em> leave me without enough money for
gas on the way home, but after some work on my truck, I didn't have an
estimate of the miles per gallon I'd get on the trip.  I thought I'd
be fine but knew that if I was wrong I could borrow money from any of
a number of people I knew who would be at the race.</p>
<p>Instead of driving directly to the start/finish site, I drove to
<a href="http://spotteddogbrewery.com/">Spotted Dog Brewery</a> because I had an
empty growler with a gift card good for a fill attached to it.  It was
awarded to me for finishing first in the drinking division last year.
I didn't fill it last year because it was awarded at the end of the
race and by then I had already drunk fourteen beers during the course
of the race and another celebratory beer or two after.  They had a wee
heavy on tap, so I chose that, but needed to pay about an extra ten
bucks because of inflation and/or the wee heavy being a bit pricier
(after all, at 9.5% ABV it is about double the strength of normal
beer).  I tipped $5, because by then I was reasonably sure I was going
to need to hit someone up for some additional gas money and I didn't
want my current cash-poor situation turning me into a stingy bastard.</p>
<p>From Spotted Dog, I drove to the <a href="https://bryanberg.net/files/outdoors-hiking-areas-with-maps/mountain-time-2/monte-vista-trail-tortugas-a-mountain/">Monte Vista Hiking Trail Parking
Log</a>.
That's where the start/finish line is and where I camp.  I got there
about and hour and a half before the race was due to start, which was
an hour before the drinkers were going to have a rule-change meeting.
Although I wasn't going to participate in the drinking division, I had
had an epiphany and realized that I could still drink a bit at the
beginning without it jeopardizing my health (e.g., allowing me to
catch a cold) or otherwise decreasing my ability to pace the Duke City
Marathon.</p>
<p>That hour and a half was enough time for me to set up my tent and socialize.
Embarrassingly, I did not recognize Rob, the founder of this event.  I know
Rob's son Justin better than Rob, although it's been a few years since I've
seen Justin and I probably couldn't pick him out of crowd either.  In addition
to Rob, who lives in Las Cruces, Kathy had driven down from Albuquerque.
Kathy had done the Feral Hog 25k six days prior, so she and I were the only
Feral Hog participants who were also doing the 24 Hour Challenge.  That
makes us Feral Tortugas!</p>
<p>In some sense, however, the two most important people I ran into were
Perky and Prince Charming.  They had ponied up for the two porta
potties.  Yay!  As we chatted, I found out that the winners (male and
female) of the beer division were <em>not</em> going to get a growler this
year.  I didn't yet know why, but I did volunteer that I had just
picked up a growler of wee heavy and before I had even asked about
borrowing gas money, Perky volunteered to by the growler for me.  I
asked for $20, which was the amount I was going to borrow, but she
handed me $30.  I wasn't going to fight her over the extra, especially
since Prince Charming could break me in half like a toothpick.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was five-thirty, a half hour before race
start and the beer drinkers gathered to hear the new rules and the big
surprise.  Instead of only the winners of the beer division getting a
gift, everyone who was going to drink a beer at this little meeting
(i.e., before the first lap) got a very nice <em>large</em> beer stein with
the Beer Soaked logo and the epitaph &quot;It's my own damn fault!&quot;  I
drank a 16 oz. 7.5% ABV <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24659/67709/">Malpais
Stout</a> and
thanked Rob profusely for this participant's award.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this race I had decided that since I wasn't
going to compete, I'd make an already social event even more social by
running each loop with a different person and chatting with (at?)
them.  However, I never articulated this plan, which was good, because
I changed my mind when I remembered that I often have a Zoom meeting
with a bunch of friends on Friday, Saturday and occasionally Wednesday
evenings at 6pm, which was the starting time for Tortugas Mountain.
They knew I was a crazy person who liked to run in circles, now I got
a chance to show them.</p>
<h2 id="loops-before-bed"><a class="header" href="#loops-before-bed">Loops Before Bed</a></h2>
<p>I finished <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7964427510">four loops</a>
before heading into my tent to sleep.</p>
<p>So, I used my phone to join the Zoom meeting, explained to the people
on the meeting what I was doing, then switched to the forward facing
camera and stayed on the meeting until the final person dropped off
about four hours later.</p>
<p>Before my second loop I had a 12 oz. 7% ABV <a href="https://santafebrewing.com/beer/social-hour/">Social
Hour</a> and before my
third loop I had a 12 oz. 7% ABV <a href="https://tumblerootbreweryanddistillery.com/beer/sunset-hazy-ipa/">Sunset Hazy
IPA</a>.
On my fourth lap I fell from grace and did not drink a beer.  This was
according to plan.  I had already had the equivalent of five beers due
to the first one being a pint rather than twelve ounces and all of
them being stronger than 5% ABV.  When competing in the drinking
division, you must drink a beer each loop (in previous years it was
<em>before</em> each loop, i.e. in the start/finish area, but this year they
relaxed the rules and allow you to drink the beer as you
run/hike/walk/stumble).  As such, when competing in the drinking
division, it makes sense to have the weakest beer allowed (5% ABV) and
the smallest amount (12 oz.) because drinking stronger beer adds up
(just ask Jason, who was drinking 7% ABV beers at the beginning last
year!).  However, since I was in the open division, stacking a little
more alcohol early was just that much more social lubricant for my
zoom call.</p>
<p>My plan had been to finish five or six laps before going to bed, but I
hadn't really thought things through and I hadn't even considered the
Zoom call, which slowed me down a bit.  So when I saw that it was about
eleven thirty at the end of my fourth lap, I decided it was a good time
to stop and get some sleep.</p>
<p>It took me a little while to sleep and I woke up a few times, both to
use my pee bottle and to hear some fun friendly noise as various
runners finished their laps.  That was great, it meant that even my
sleeping was semi-social.</p>
<p>At 5:15 my alarm went off like it usually does and I had the double espresso
I had made at home and brought with me.  I probably have a double espresso
at 5:15 Mountain time 360 days a year.  Every once in a while I shift when
I have it, but only in extenuating circumstances.  I typically wake up
well before 5:15 but wait until 5:15 (on the second!) to drink the espresso
because I use it to synchronize my sleep so that I don't get up earlier and
earlier or later and later and to also tell my GI system to do its thing.</p>
<p>It was still dark out, so I put my Kogolla light bar and Petzl headlamp
back on (those are what I was using the night before) putzed around a bit
hoping for the caffeine to allow me to take a dump, got impatient and
finally started my next loops at 5:36am.</p>
<h2 id="loops-after-bed"><a class="header" href="#loops-after-bed">Loops After Bed</a></h2>
<p>I completed <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7969011612">ten loops</a>
after sleeping.</p>
<p>Although I had much less sleep and a lower quality of sleep than normal,
I felt great.  My lighting was excellent and it was a bit cooler. I ran
my first few post-bedtime laps in a little under an hour each, and that
includes the time I was taking to eat like a piggy at the start/finish
aid station as well as at the aid station that is roughly at the half-way
point.</p>
<p>I had really enjoyed my Zoom the night before, so I did something
similar at 11am.  I have a different group of people who have a
recurring 11am daily zoom.  I've known some of these people for close
to thirty years but I only recently found out that they had this Zoom
call every day (perhaps I knew that at one point and forgot, but I'm
not on Facebook and I don't recall reading about it on our mailing
list).  There were only two others on the call, but it was fun to do a
show-and-tell and answer questions for about a half hour.</p>
<p>Like many a looped-course ultra, this race was run &quot;washing-machine&quot;
style, meaning runners switch directions for each loop.  The first and
all odd loops were run clockwise (as viewed from above), the second
and all even loops counter-clockwise.  That allows competitors to see
their competition and allows social participants to see the entire
field, at least briefly, several times.  However, it did conspire
against allowing me to spend time with Lukas, the winner.  We were
chatting a little bit at the start/finish aid station, and we
continued our conversation as we jogged together back to the main
course, but, alas, he turned right and I turned left. For the next
several loops, I'd see Lukas at the start/finish aid station, it was
almost like clockwork.  The difference though is that before we synced
up he had already run <em>seven</em> more laps than I had! He also chose to
run a final lap after I had called it a day, so he got twenty-two laps
in all told, while I finished a mere fourteen.</p>
<p>Around 2pm I was finishing my twelfth lap and I had already worked out
the numbers.  If I sped up a little I could get three more laps in
before the 6pm finish time, but that would be taxing, might increase
my chance of injury and would leave me little time to tear down my
tent and put things away before the awards ceremony.  As such, I
decided that I would do fourteen laps this year, just like last year,
but since it was in the open division, I wouldn't even podium.  Last
year my fourteen laps (and fourteen &quot;beers&quot; (they were mostly hard
seltzers which I might explain sometime, but not now)) was not just
first place in the drinking division but a new course record.</p>
<p>Once I realized I was only going to do two more laps, I decided to see
if I could mooch a beer for each of my two final laps.  There would be
four hours between the first of the two beers and the end of the race
and about two and a half before the second beer and the end of the
race and even after the end of the race was the awards ceremony, so I
would still be able to drive safely, legally and comfortably.  I came
into the aid station and asked if anyone could give me a beer and the
few people who were there were all out of beer!  Someone, however,
(Marco?), let me know that earlier Perky and Prince Charming had
offered him a beer which he had declined, so he retroactively accepted
that beer and gave it to me (i.e., we pilfered a Miller High Life from
their cooler).  I know P&amp;PC well enough to know that they wouldn't
mind and that I probably was not draining them dry.</p>
<p>Guess whom I saw when finishing my thirteenth lap!?  Sure enough P&amp;PC
were at their tailgate, parked next to my truck, and I got to confess
my sin.  They were amused and volunteered to give me another beer.  I
could have another Miller High Life or—what the heck&amp;mash;we
could open the growler.  They even had a nice <em>small</em> plastic cup I
could pour the growler into.  I was sold.  I did have to be careful
to limit myself, because this was indeed stronger brew, but it was
only 3:30pm and I wouldn't be driving until 6:15 or 6:30.</p>
<p>I had some of the wee heavy and was futzing with my stuff as P&amp;PC
departed.  Like I, they were going to head out on a counter-clockwise
loop.  I knew I would catch up with them and this time, I'd actually
hang out and chat on the loop.  So, a little while later I topped off
my beer and headed up.  I wanted to catch up, but I also didn't want
to spill my beer.  I didn't execute perfectly and there was a little
sloshing over the side, but shortly I was within chatting distance.</p>
<p>Perky walks quickly!  Here walking pace is slower than mine, so she
would get ahead of Prince Charming and myself and eventually PC would
remind me to run a bit to catch up so that I wouldn't have to shout so
much.  We had good time catching up and discussing our plans for 2023.</p>
<h2 id="post-race-1"><a class="header" href="#post-race-1">Post-Race</a></h2>
<p>At 5:09 I was done with my laps and done drinking until after noon the
following day.  I pulled out my cooler and spent about a half hour
packing my sleeping mat, eating recovery food fortified (with chia
seeds, hemp seeds, soy milk and Udo's Oil)) oatmeal, nasty green
drink, rice milk and some spaghetti and most importantly listening to
everyone's stories.  I then hastily packed my tent, gathered the rest
of my gear and shoved everything in my truck so that I could be back
for the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>The two times I've done this previously, I've left my tent set up and
gone back to it after the ceremony.  This year, with the start of the
Duke City Marathon less than thirteen hours away, I said thanks,
hopped in my truck, drove to a gas station, bought fifty dollars of
fuel, saw that my tank was almost full, crossed my fingers and got on
the road.  Oh, while the gas was pumping, I had the choice: eat more
spaghetti or clean the bug blots off my windshield.  The splats were a
bit of a nuisance, but I was hungry, so I left them there.</p>
<p>My drive back was mostly uneventful.  I was not tired.  I was not wired.
I wasn't overly anxious, but I did continue looking at the gas gauge with
regularity.  I had one obnoxious driver to deal with, but luckily that
vehicle pulled off in Truth or Consequences (that's the name of a town).</p>
<p>Everything was basically going fine until I ran into a little rain.
My truck has fairly dim headlights (although they're a little bit
brighter than they had been a few days go before I replaced a bulb)
and my night vision isn't great.  My windshield wipers are pretty
poor, but it wasn't supposed to rain until the next day, or at least
that's what I thought.  Had I known it would rain, I wouldn't have
eaten that spaghetti.  Light rain, bug bits, and poor windshield
wipers are a bad combination, especially at night.  Luckily, there
were some gaps in the slime that I could see through until the rain
came down harder and everything got cleaned up.</p>
<p>I got home around 9:30, started charging my electrical stuff, took a
shower, put away a few things, set my alarm for 4:30am and got to bed
around 11pm.  Tomorrow would be fun (and I'm not being sarcastic).</p>
<p>Whee!</p>
<h2 id="food"><a class="header" href="#food">&quot;Food&quot;</a></h2>
<p>I brought some food from Albuquerque and think I might have had enough
calories to squeak by, but there was yummy junk food at the aid stations
so I ate a ton of that during the race.</p>
<p>Sophie had made a bunch of potato slices roasted in spiced oil.  I had a few
in Albuquerque for lunch, then stuffed a lot more in a baggie for the
drive down.  Sure enough, I ate them all.</p>
<p>Before the race I ate a bag of lentils (2/3rds cup when they were
dry).  I had made an entire package of spaghetti (approximately 2,000
calories), but only ate a little of that during the race.  Most came
back to Albuquerque with me and I ate it on the Monday and Tuesday
after the race.</p>
<p>Sophie had made some homemade hummus and I took half of it with me in a
baggie.  With the baggie sitting on top of the ice in the cooler, the hummus
took on a Play-Doh consistency, which was great, because I could tear off a
piece and eat it without utensils.  I also brought a baggie of steamed
broccoli and cauliflower that I ate mid-day Saturday.</p>
<p>I ate a huge amount of aid station &quot;orange slice&quot; candies and pretzels
on both days.  Thanks!</p>
<p>On Saturday, I additionally snacked on salt &amp; vinegar potato chips,
some vegan cookies that were kind of like cream colored Oreos and some
vegan Dijon mustard crisps.  I had a Mountain Dew after each of my first
two Saturday laps.</p>
<p>At the remote aid station, after I had eaten all the orange slice candies,
I had a big handful of M&amp;Ms and eight tiny Twix bites.  Neither of those
are vegan; they both have milk in them.  I believe those were the only two
non-vegan things I consumed.</p>
<h2 id="minor-setbacks"><a class="header" href="#minor-setbacks">Minor Setbacks</a></h2>
<h3 id="chafing-1"><a class="header" href="#chafing-1">Chafing</a></h3>
<p>I did not bring Body Glide and my running shorts irritated me a little
bit.  I also was wearing an ultra-vest without a shirt when I was using
my Kogolla light bar because I wanted something to hold the battery
and (when not Zooming) my iPod touch.  However, at one point I also
added tube filled with water and that extra pressure was enough to
chafe my right nipple.  Eventually I realized what was going on and
moved the water to the other side and everything was fine.</p>
<h3 id="sunburn"><a class="header" href="#sunburn">Sunburn</a></h3>
<p>I didn't wear any sunscreen, so I got a minor sunburn.  I definitely didn't
feel it at the time, so I don't think it slowed me down appreciably.  I felt
it slightly after getting home. Over the next couple of days the red turned
to tan, so I'm happy.</p>
<h3 id="falling"><a class="header" href="#falling">Falling</a></h3>
<p>I fell and hit the ground a few times.  The first two or three times were,
IIRC, Saturday, i.e., after I had slept, before I was drinking beer again.
I tore some skin here and there but none were bad enough to introduce a
limp or cause trouble post race.</p>
<h3 id="heat"><a class="header" href="#heat">Heat</a></h3>
<p>I had meant to bring my ice hat and use it, both because I think it speeds
me up, but also to get a little practice with it before Javelina Jundred.
I even had it in the file that I created that had the
list of things to bring, but I forgot to look at that file.</p>
<h2 id="music-driven-legs"><a class="header" href="#music-driven-legs">Music Driven Legs</a></h2>
<p>I easily get the runner's high.  While I have it, music often hits me
emotionally.  I feel like I'm a bull being led by a nose-ring and when
the music is upbeat or perhaps just emotionally satisfying, I
sometimes use it to drive my legs.  One song that touched me while I
was out there was City of New Orleans.  City of New Orleans was
written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Goodman">Steve
Goodman</a> but made famous
by Arlo Guthrie.  Neither of those two were singing it, but since it
came off my iPod library, I might eventually figure out whose version
it was.</p>
<p>Listening to anything Steve Goodman had to do with always brings out a mix
of emotions in me.  The guy died of cancer when he was 36 but penned and
performed many a classic.  City of New Orleans isn't particularly fast,
and I find it melancholy, but it was definitely driving my legs hard as I
finished up one of my daylight even laps.  I can't remember the other
songs that wound me up, although one of them was by Jesus Jones.</p>
<h2 id="historical"><a class="header" href="#historical">Historical</a></h2>
<p>The Tortuga Mountain 24 Hour Challenge started out as a drinking event, where
all participants were required to drink a beer before each 4 mile loop around
Tortugas Mountain (also known as &quot;A&quot; Mountain due to the capital 'A' in white
rock on the hill that is visible for miles).  The beer needed to be 12 ounces
or more and 5% ABV or more.</p>
<p>As the event became popular, some people chose to do it without all
the beer, so separate divisions were created.  These divisions are
recognized at the event itself, but are not made in the UltraSignup
results. So, you can either take my word or ask a race director, but
in 2021, I set a new course record of 14 beers and <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=83711#id220546">56
miles</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="duke-city-marathon-2022"><a class="header" href="#duke-city-marathon-2022">Duke City Marathon 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview-6"><a class="header" href="#overview-6">Overview</a></h2>
<p>I ran
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/1458">4:59:51</a>,
<em>much</em> (i.e., nine seconds) too quickly.  My
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7974024108">miles</a> weren't
particularly consistent, either, with my fastest complete mile being
10:58 and my final .43 mile being 10:21.  My slowest mile was 12:01.</p>
<h2 id="practice"><a class="header" href="#practice">Practice</a></h2>
<p>I take my pacing seriously.  In the week before DCM, I did four 4.0
mile test runs, where my goal was to run an 11:27 pace for exactly 4
miles. I hit my goal each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7946619899">45:56</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7952148780">45:56</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7957238032">45:54</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7961958284">45:54</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used two GPS watches, one showing my my overall average pace and the
other showing me my instantaneous pace.  The problem is that neither
watch gives me a particularly accurate instantaneous pace, but with
both watches and practice I can do fairly well.</p>
<h2 id="sign-up"><a class="header" href="#sign-up">Sign-Up</a></h2>
<p>I got to run this for free, so I don't want to sound like I'm whining,
but there always seems to be additional complication doing this as a
pacer, because instead of using an online form to register, I got a
PDF which I then filled out and submitted to Glenda which she then
submitted to the Duke City Marathon people.</p>
<p>Just as I was approaching the Spotted Dog Brewery I got a text message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Clifford, this is [redacted] with the Duke City Marathon. We received your form, but there is no race checked off. Can you please let me know which race you would like to run</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a light I responded with </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Marathon. I'm the 5 hour pace group leader&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't attempt to look up my details while I was away from home
(doing the <a href="running/past/tortugas_mountain_2022.html">Tortugas 24 Hour Challenge</a>).
Race morning I wanted to see how people could track me and I found I
was listed as &quot;Cliff&quot;, not &quot;Clifford&quot; as I had written on the form and
as I was messaged. Even worse, my age was listed as 42.  These
differences don't matter to me personally, but streamlining and
bug-fixing the pacer process might allow DCM to get more pacers in the
future.</p>
<h2 id="weather"><a class="header" href="#weather">Weather</a></h2>
<p>On Friday morning, before I left for Las Cruces (returning Saturday
evening), I had already checked the DCM race-day weather and saw that
it was going to be low fifties, winds around twenty five miles per
hour and rain.  Wind (except when it's a tailwind) is always annoying,
especially when carrying a sign, but my big worry was that I am used
to dressing lightly and speeding up to keep my body warm.  As a pacer,
it's my duty to keep a steady pace.  So I set aside a long sleeve
shirt, a fleece hat, light rain jacket, gloves and hand warmers for
race day morning.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race-2"><a class="header" href="#pre-race-2">Pre-Race</a></h2>
<p>My alarm went off at 4:30 and I downed a double espresso that I had
made previously.  Almost every other day I have my double espresso at
5:15, but I wanted to make sure I had plenty of time to poop before
driving to the convention center.</p>
<p>I ate a 533 calorie serving of my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt">fortified
oatmeal</a>
at 4:45.  If it hadn't been for the weather, I'd have probably just
started the race in a fasted state, since I can run or bike slowly for
several hours in that state. However, I didn't want to risk it, since
it was my duty to keep a steady pace.</p>
<p>I got to the convention center parking lot with plenty of time to spare.
I made my way to the Albuquerque Road Runners bag drop to pick up my bib
and sign.  I chatted a bit with Dennis and Glenda and as time passed, I
decided to ditch more and more of my rain gear.  Eventually I decided to
use the hand warmers (because they're trivial to throw away if they get
annoying) and to tie my rain jacket around my waist.</p>
<p>As usual, the Road Runners had a huge bowl of tiny Tootsie Rolls an as
usual, I ate a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>At some point, I Judy (see below) introduced herself to me and let me know
she was going to run around my pace because she was training for an upcoming
fifty miler. Yay! Go Judy!</p>
<p>I met
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/274">Andrew</a>,
the 3:45 pace group leader and
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/1459">Nick</a>,
the 4:00 pace group leader.  We chatted a bit about running, then
headed out to hold up our signs so people could find us.</p>
<p>Days after finishing DCM, I looked up Nick on UltraSignup and saw that
he had come in
<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=80566#id1112065">3rd</a>!
(just after <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Luke&amp;lname=Nelson&amp;age=41">Luke
Nelson</a>!)
in the <a href="https://www.plain100.com/">Plain 100</a> in 2021.  I am not
worthy; I suck at navigating (although I'm <a href="https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524">OK with a pack)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-1"><a class="header" href="#the-race-1">The Race</a></h2>
<h3 id="first-half"><a class="header" href="#first-half">First Half</a></h3>
<p>As usual, I was a chatterbox in the first half.  I volunteered a lot
of advice to anyone willing to listen or who was stuck nearby.  I
tried to emphasize that people are different and that I don't
necessarily know what I'm doing, and I tried to add some
self-deprecating remarks, but <a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/louse-seeing-one-ladys-bonnet-church/">who
knows?</a></p>
<p>I tried to get names and stories from people running with me, but I didn't
take notes after the race and so I've already forgotten many details.  Four
people I do remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/189">Judy</a>, an ultra runner with an upcoming 50 miler</li>
<li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/165">Chris</a>, an Economics Ph.D. student, former programmer and poker enthusiast</li>
<li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/158">Michael</a>, a jiu-jitsu fighter from Arizona</li>
<li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/361">Gus</a>, who was sufficiently silent in the first half to escape my attempted friendliness</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first mile I mentioned that I think the shorter the distance a
race is, the harder it is.  I elaborated to Chris, by mentioning that
<em>typically</em> goals change due to the distance. i.e., when you're
sprinting, your only goal is to finish as quickly as possible; when
you're running a marathon your goal tends to be to PR and/or correct
previous mistakes, but when running an ultra often your only goal is
to finish.</p>
<p>Judy and I talked a little bit about ultra-running before she got ahead
of me.</p>
<p>Before too long, Michael and I traded story after story. That may have been
boring (or worse!) for the others, but we didn't care; we were clicking off
miles and having a great day. As the turn-around approached, Michael bid me
goodbye, knowing that he was going to run the second half a little slower.</p>
<p>I noticed Gus, but at this point he wasn't part of the conversation and
I didn't know whether he was deliberately running our pace or if he
just happened to be there.  In retrospect, heh!</p>
<h3 id="second-half"><a class="header" href="#second-half">Second Half</a></h3>
<p>After the turnaround, I saw the 13 mile sign, checked my GPS watch and saw
that it said 13.18 miles. Uh oh. That's a big enough discrepancy that a
11:27 pace is not going to get me to the finish line in five hours. Although
I'd like to hit five hours exactly, I'd rather finish slightly early than 
slightly late, because if anyone is following me and wants to get sub five,
they may not think about the fact that it's chip timed and they may have
started in front of me, in which case they need to finish in front of me
too.  Being early just exacerbates that problem.</p>
<p>Since there was a little bit of a tailwind, I chose to speed up a
little bit and bring my average pace to around 11:24.  I also decided
that I should probably ingest some calories, since I hadn't eaten or
drank anything since the race started.  I had five gels with me and
planned on eating three, but I accidentally got four out, so that's
what I ate.  Tearing open the packets and making sure not to
accidentally drop anything while holding the &quot;5:00&quot; sign was an
exercise in clumsiness, but I got it done.</p>
<p>Before too long I started having a cup of water at some of the aid
stations.  I'm a firm believer in drinking only when I'm thirsty and I
hadn't been thirsty up until then. Between it getting warmer, me
having more miles on my legs and the gels (at least two of the four
were caffeinated), I got slightly thirsty, so I drank a little here
and there.</p>
<p>As I ran westward on Paseo del Norte I ran into Judy.  Looking at my
splits, I now know I was running about a 10:57 minute/mile pace.  At
the time I knew I was running faster than 11:27 because I was trying
go get down to 11:24 overall.  If I had confidence in the mile marking
and my math, I might have tried to run a little slower, but I figured
if I was going to make a mistake and run a little too quickly, doing
so here, with the tailwind and before everyone was hitting the wall
would be best.</p>
<p>Not too long after turning south on the Bosque Bike Path, I had a
chance to chat with
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/397">Julie</a>,
a <a href="http://www.50statesmarathonclub.com/">50 states</a> member who plans
to finish in Hawaii.  She told me how many states she had left and I
think it was eight.  I believe she's hoping to finish three or four a
year.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it wasn't too long after chatting with Julie
that I started talking with Chris again. Eventually I confessed to be
working on poker software and we chatted a bit about that.
Unfortunately, I got wrapped up in the conversation and let my pace
gradually speed up.  I don't know if it was due to my increased pace,
but Chris developed a cramp at some point and I didn't see him again,
although looking at the results I see he (5:20:58) and Julie (5:20:53)
finished within five seconds of each other. Neat!</p>
<p>I sort of thought I was all alone, except the quiet guy was still
there.  I think it was around twenty miles in when I started chatting
him up.  He seemed to be breathing a bit hard, so initially I expected
him to drop off, but it turns out he had been deliberately following me
because he had indeed wanted to finish sub five.</p>
<p>Eventually I learned this formerly silent guy was Gus. What I didn't
know until after the race was over is that my ultra running friend
<a href="https://www.athlinks.com/event/35398/results/Event/1032202/Course/2296576/Bib/339">John
Hancock</a>
had pointed Gus at me.  Gus had found John through Strava and when
John heard that Gus wanted to run sub five he pointed me out.  I had
seen John before the race start and he even mentioned that he had sent
someone my way, but at the time Gus wasn't around, so I didn't know
whom he had sent.</p>
<p>One of the markers—23, I think—toward the end of the
course agreed with my watch.  This was a little disconcerting, because
most of the previous ones had all been around .2 miles further than my
watch was claiming I had run.  If this new one was correct, then I've
been running much too fast, so once again I slowed down a bit, only to
get to find the next sign about .2 miles further than my GPS watch
said. D'oh!</p>
<p>I don't know for sure what was happening with the signs. I believe
courses are supposed to be measured by running a wheel along the
shortest distance within the cones and I most definitely wasn't
running the tangents.  However, at one point—25, I
think—the marathon and half marathon distance signs were fairly
close to each other and since the rest of the course was shared, that
couldn't be right, because they should be a tenth of a mile apart.</p>
<p>With less than a mile to go I encouraged Gus to run ahead so that he
would lock down his sub-five (which he did with a 4:59:38 finish).  I was
alone and trying to adjust my speed to take into consideration how much
further I thought might be left in both distance and time.  Someone saw
me approaching him and shouted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and sped up.  He was going for sub-five. I occasionally shouted
&quot;Run!&quot;  at him because I didn't want him to be caught short by the
chip timing.</p>
<h2 id="post-race-2"><a class="header" href="#post-race-2">Post Race</a></h2>
<p>As I approached the finish line it was clear I was going to finish too
quickly.  I slowed down to add a few seconds, but I didn't want to
slow too much (much less come to a complete stop) in order to finish
closer to 5:00:00. This was not the year to beat my record of being
only three seconds off.</p>
<p>Glenda found me after crossing the finish line as did John Hancock.
That's when I learned that Gus had been sent by John.  I returned to
the ARR bag drop area and fetched some recovery food (another serving
of fortified oatmeal) and beverages (<a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/rice_milk.txt">rice
milk</a>
and a <a href="https://tumblerootbreweryanddistillery.com/beer/sunset-hazy-ipa/">Best Energy Electrolyte
Replacement</a>).</p>
<p>I hung around the bag drop area until they were ready to tear down
most of it.  I then helped schlep some of the gear to Dennis's car
before driving over to Marcia's and Jeff's where the fed and beveraged
me.</p>
<h2 id="historical-1"><a class="header" href="#historical-1">Historical</a></h2>
<p>This was my fourth time leading the five hour pace group. I started doing it in
2017 and decided to do it every year, but there was no DCM in 2020 due to
covid and the Albuquerque Road Runners didn't supply pace group leaders in
2021, so my streak is sort of unbroken.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://results.rmraces.live/duke-city-marathon/events/2017/2017-duke-city-marathon/466/entrant?share=1">2017 4:59:54</a></li>

<li><a href="https://results.rmraces.live/sve-socal/events/2019/36th-annual-big-5-duke-city-marathon/330/entrant?share=1">2019 5:00:19</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal was to run a steady 4:27 minute / mile and then to adjust my
speed in the last quarter to half mile to cross the timing mat at
exactly 5:00:00.  This was a little tricky because my GPS watch wasn't
necessarily going to agree on the distance in the best of circumstances,
but especially with this year's mile marker placements.</p>
<p>I was a little nervous running a 24 hour race the day before (i.e. the
end of the 24-hour event was thirteen hours before the start of DCM),
although I did have precedent for running a big event the day
before. Although in 2017, I hadn't run anything since the Mt. Taylor
50k three weeks and a day prior, in 2018 I ran the White Mesa 50k the
day before and in 2019 I ran the Sandia Crossing Marathon 7:24:30 the
day before.  It's not that I deliberately look for events to do the
day before the Duke City Marathon, it's just that running at an 11:27
min/mile pace is not that challenging.</p>
<p>So, this year, when I found that the Tortugas Mountain 24 Hour
Challenge was being held in Las Cruces the day before, I chose to do
the challenge, but enter the non-drinking division and cap my miles at
60 (or 64). Initially I had also planned on not drinking during Tortugas
Mountain, but I changed my mind and simply drank considerably less and
delayed my celebratory drinking until post DCM.</p>
<p>It all worked out fine, but the drive back from Las Cruces was a bit
nerve-racking, because I didn't know when I'd get to sleep, how well
I'd sleep or how fit I would feel in the morning.  Turns out, I got to
bed late, slept poorly, felt great and had no trouble performing my
pacing duties.</p>
<h2 id="pix"><a class="header" href="#pix">Pix</a></h2>
<p>I participate in so many events that it's exceedingly rare that I buy
photos (especially since some events provide photos for free), but
Foggy Bay Photos was out taking pictures and
<a href="https://thefoggybay.shootproof.com/gallery/19549154/search?q=1458">here</a>
are the ones they took of me.</p>
<h2 id="more-to-add-later"><a class="header" href="#more-to-add-later">More to Add, Later</a></h2>
<p>All told, I took 800mg of ibuprofen: 400mg around 4:45am, with my
fortified oatmeal and another 400mg soon after having my gels, just past
the turnaround.</p>
<p>The first amount of ibuprofen was to counter any minor discomfort that
might show up due to my participation in the Tortugas Mountain 24-Hour
Challenge.  The latter was due to minor discomfort that I was feeling
in my knees, that I <em>think</em> was due to the way carrying a sign altered
my gait.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is a tricky subject, so my plan is to eventually create a
section of this book that explains when I use it and why and also
mentions some of the risks.  I've had at least two good friends of
mine go to the hospital for kidney failure due, in part, to overuse
of ibuprofen. So, rather than mentioning that in this race report,
I'll eventually take the time to mention it in the upcoming <code>Ibuprofen</code>
section of my upcoming <code>Drugs</code> section of my upcoming <code>Practices</code> section.</p>
<p>I don't know when I'll get to the above. I do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz0EdL8TyT4">Day
Job</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Yeah, I'll add a <code>Grateful Dead</code> section too; I was lucky enough
to go to many shows back in the day, including this one.</p>

<h2 id="overview-7"><a class="header" href="#overview-7">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Like Memorial Day, the <a href="https://www.core-crew.com/tatonka-5-10k-run">Tatonka
5k</a> is both a somber
reflection of tragic loss as well as a celebration of life and
values. Billed as a Fun Run, it is an event put on by the brother and
mother of SFC Matthew Q. McClintock, RIP.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8003156778">not trip</a>
and keep my heart rate up fairly high considering I didn't have any
extra pre-race caffeine.  My effort was sufficient to get me
<a href="https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=295185&amp;did=352356">nineteenth
place</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-ruck"><a class="header" href="#what-the-ruck">What the Ruck?</a></h2>
<p>I chose to run the 5k wearing my backpack filled to the weight I train
with.  Specifically, when training on level ground I get the pack to
weigh at least forty pounds.  In this case it was forty-one point
eight pounds, because I didn't want to alter its contents after having
run a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7988067492">leisurely training
run</a> three days prior.</p>
<p>Last year I rode the Day of the Tread bicycle Century six days prior
to Javelina Jundred.  I had planned on doing the same this year, until
I saw that Forever Young, an Albuquerque Road Runners race that has
been held in April in the past, was going to be held on the same day as
Day of the Tread.  &quot;Good! I can take Saturday off, run my guts out
at Forever Young and still beat myself up less than slowly riding DotT&quot;
I thought to myself.</p>
<p>However, I learned about the Tatonka 5k when the results for the Feral
Hog 50k was posted.  It was an excellent cause and it was the day
before Forever Young, so I decided to do both.  Since I'll be doing
some serious rucking in 2023, I figured I could just slap my ruck on
and get some decent training effect.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race-3"><a class="header" href="#pre-race-3">Pre Race</a></h2>
<p>The race was scheduled to start at 10am which is something my body
isn't used to.  So, I got there a bit early just so I could try to
calm my GI tract.  While I was there, I ran into a familiar face from
the pre-covid Albuquerque Team RWB chapter.  Sadly, I couldn't
remember his name immediately, so I fessed up and asked.  &quot;Don!&quot; Of
course.</p>
<p>Don and I chatted a bit here and there, including what's been going on
in his life the last few years.  Somehow the Cocodona 250 came up and
I mentioned that because I had to do it without a crew or pacer, I wound
up running it very conservatively which meant I was sufficiently fresh
at the Mt. Elden aid station that I could drink a beer and have a shot
of Cinnamon Fireball.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-2"><a class="header" href="#the-race-2">The Race</a></h2>
<p>The race, like the annual Memorial Day service, was held in the <a href="https://nmvetsmemorial.org/">New
Mexico Veterans Memorial</a>. The course was
designed to allow the runners to see some of the key features of the
memorial, which was great, but it was a bit &quot;squirrelly&quot;.  There were
several turns and the surface was a mix of asphalt, dirt, concrete and
even some grass.</p>
<p>I had to pay close attention not to trip and fall.  I do not like
falling when running with my pack, especially falling when I'm turning
a corner.  It's bad enough scraping my knees when falling forward, but
the one or two times when I've fallen while turning a corner, I've
jacked up my shoulders.  Luckily, those falls happen up in the Sandias
where there's nobody to see.  It's not that I'd be embarrassed to have
someone see me fall; I have no shame.  It's just that when I do fall
during races (e.g. during the <a href="running/past/big_cottonwood_marathon_2022.html#bam">Big Cottonwood Marathon
2022</a>) it freaks people out and
mars <em>their</em> race.</p>
<p>So, my primary goal was to not trip. My secondary goal was to run hard
and not take my foot off the gas.  I succeeded in both.  Yay!</p>
<h2 id="post-race-3"><a class="header" href="#post-race-3">Post Race</a></h2>
<p>Before Don finished, I had a celebratory beer, and started eating my
fortified oatmeal, and drinking my rice milk.  Then I congratulated
Don on finishing before sitting down and chatting with a few runners
I didn't know.</p>
<p>They collected people's bibs an then drew door prizes and Don won a
gigantic plastic candy cane filled with—what a strange
coincidence— shots of Cinnamon Fireball.  I don't take a lot of
selfies, but when I do, I'm often drinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Cheers!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ate couple handfuls of pretzels, watched the awards ceremony, then
left for an afternoon of doing things on &quot;that side of town&quot;, which
included buying coffee, buying beer, drinking beer with my sister and
brother-in-law and visiting my mom.</p>
<p>Oh, and on my way back to my truck, before those errands and visits, I
cried a bit.</p>
<h2 id="historical-2"><a class="header" href="#historical-2">Historical</a></h2>
<p>Just in case the Tatonka 5k link goes stale, here's what it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 7th Annual Tatonka 5K Trail Run is a fundraising fun run to
raise money for Green Beret Foundation in memory of SFC Matthew
Q. McClintock. The Green Beret Foundation helps soldiers and their
families with needs like family care, medical support, travel,
careers, etc. Matthew passed away on January 5th, 2016 while helping
to save his teammates in Afghanistan. All of his teammates survived
the mission. He will always be remembered as an American Hero. He
put his life on the line to be out there fighting with his teammates
and would do it 1000 times over again because that's what they
do. They do whatever it takes to have each other's backs. Matthew
was 30 years old. He is survived by his wife and 6 year old son.</p>
<p>All funds raised will go to the Green Beret Foundation.</p>
<p>This year we are moving to a beautiful new venue! The Veterans
Memorial Park at 1100 Louisiana Blvd SE in Albuquerque. The park has
some wonderful areas with information about lots of our New Mexico
veterans. The course will be rather circuitous but allow us to take
you to the most interesting places in the park. You will run, jog or
walk 3 laps of the 1.1 mile loop finishing in the amphitheatre for
the awards. Highlight the links below for all the race details and
course map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew's mother did some of the emceeing of the event and his
brother—who came up with the idea of a run to celebrate
Matthew's life—was out and about doing several things including
leading the way around the first lap.</p>

<p>My official time was
<a href="https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=295372&amp;did=352657">47:18.0</a>. That's
a pretty big difference from
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8008642254">49:50</a>, which is what
my GPS watch recorded.  In 2019, my official time was 48:05, which is just a few
seconds different from what my GPS watch said.</p>
<p>Looking at my splits, my guess is my GPS watch is closer to the truth
than the official time. Using my GPS watch time gives me an 8:17
min/mile average pace.</p>
<p>I chose to race—not merely run—this event, meaning I went
as hard as I could, at least until the final mile or so when it was
clear that I wasn't going to overtake anyone and nobody was going to
overtake me.</p>
<p>Gene Kersh is the only person older than I who finished before I did. However,
Gene is 64 and I'm not yet 60 and Gene beat me by over a minute!</p>

<p>I botched my <a href="running/past/tatonka_5k_2022.html">Tatonka 5k</a> recovery in two ways.
Saturday morning, I accidentally left my lunch at home, which resulted
in me eating different food (and much more food) after Tatonka than I
had planned.  I also let a toothache get out of control, so I wound up
waking up several times in the night between Tatonka and Forever
Young.</p>
<p>On Forever Young race day, since my gut had more in it than normal and
since I was more tired than I expected to be, I doubled down on
caffeine and had both a 12 oz. Michael Thomas light roast coffee as
well as a quad espresso before the race.  I was hoping the extra
caffeine would stimulate my GI system and also lessen the tooth
discomfort.  I think it did both, but I also suspect it slowed me down
by raising my temperature.</p>
<p>At one point I got a very high honor.  Glenda asked, on her husband
Dennis's behalf, for the recipe to my <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/recipes/fortified_oatmeal.txt">fortified
oatmeal</a>.
Dennis and I share a birthday, but in five weeks, when I turn sixty,
Dennis will be turning eighty two!  I don't know what specifically I
do that helps me recover quickly; I just know there are a lot of
things I do regularly that I think / hope help me recover, and
fortified oatmeal is absolutely my primary recovery food.</p>
<p>Forever Young is <a href="running/past/forever_young_six_miler_2022.html#historical">named after Charlie Young</a>.  Charlie
ran without a shirt, even in &quot;cold&quot; weather.  I also often run without
a shirt, even in &quot;cold&quot; weather and for that reason, an not as a
tribute, per-se, I was shirtless pre-race and during the race.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-3"><a class="header" href="#the-race-3">The Race</a></h2>
<p>Not much to say.  In general, we spread out fairly quickly and reached our
own speeds, so there wasn't much passing or being passed.  There was, however,
one gentleman who looked like he might be in his fifties that I had my eye on.
I tried to stay ahead of him in the beginning, but decided to let him get ahead
of me fairly early on because I didn't want to blow up.  About two thirds of
the way into the race, I passed him and by the time I was running the long
downhill toward the finish line, he was nowhere to be seen.  Gene, however,
was also nowhere to be seen, although he was ahead of me.</p>
<h2 id="post-race-4"><a class="header" href="#post-race-4">Post Race</a></h2>
<p>I had my cooler, some clothes to change into and a chair waiting for
me in the shade, so I opened my chair and drank <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/423/43670/">a
beer</a> before
digging into my oatmeal and rice milk.</p>
<p>Remember this year's <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/past/duke_city_marathon_2022.html#pre-race">3:45 Duke City Marathon
pacer</a>,
Andrew Peloquin? He took fifth at Forever Young.  Unfortunately, I did
not recognize him, so I didn't get a chance to chat with him.</p>
<p>I did, however, get a chance to chat with Gene, but it was only after
I was back home and looking at Strava that I realized the Gene I had
been talking to was Gene Kersh.  Gene has been doing the Mt. Taylor
Winter Quadrathlon for years and always finishes long before I do
(e.g., in 2015, he finished in 5:36:05 and I finished almost an hour
later in 6:32:20). Gene has run the La Luz Trail Run in under two
hours in his fifties. I've chatted with him before, so it's
embarrassing that even after he told me his first name, I didn't put
two and two together.</p>
<p>There were no vegan burritos available, but there were vegetarian ones with
green chile.  They were served as halves, so I had three.  I also had a few
vegetarian, but not vegan, chocolate chip cookies. I offered to help with
the tear-down, but they had plenty of hands, so I headed home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/forever-young-run.html">Forever Young</a>

haven't made time to write up a race report yet.  I do have notes, so

<p>It was chilly in temperature, but warm in atmosphere or perhaps that
was the two Santa Fe Brewing <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1683/289386/">7k IPA</a>s and the shot of Dewar's Whisky
that I had at the halfway point.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8080161623">got 'er done</a>, but
will not write up a race report until after I've written up my JJ100
adventure.  And <em>that's</em> the downside to running a hundred miler six
days after finishing a hundred miler: no time to write race reports.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8093196178">this</a> happened.</p>

<h2 id="three-training-blocks"><a class="header" href="#three-training-blocks">Three training blocks</a></h2>
<p>For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fun Around</li>
<li>Bataan Memorial Death March</li>
<li>Hardrock (or qualifier)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm currently in my &quot;fun around&quot; training block; it ends in mid
November.  During this block I participate in a lot of events, but
actually race in very few.</p>
<p>After that I am in a <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March">serious training
block</a> for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.</p>
<p>My final block leads up to Hardrock (if I get in) or a qualifier or
two if I don't get in. Actually, even if I do get in to Hardrock, I'll be
running the Bigfoot 200, but if my finances are secure, and I don't
get in to Hardrock, I'll also run Ehunmilak.  After that, I'm back to
a &quot;fun around&quot; block.</p>
<h2 id="events-ill-probably-participate-in"><a class="header" href="#events-ill-probably-participate-in">Events I'll Probably Participate In</a></h2>
<p>Here's what I think I'll be running in the remainder of 2022 and in 2023.
I'm signed up for everything (other than King of the Hill which isn't
taking registrations yet) through the Bataan Memorial Death March
and a few events after that.  My participation in the Tough Ruck and
Cocodona 250 is predicated on me successfully launching
<a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a>, which looks promising, but
is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's shareholders are my
highest priority. However, my running and rucking seem to help me at
work.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wylie_Hubbard">Ray Wylie Hubbard</a>
closes his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w">Mother
Blues</a> with the words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the days that I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations, I
have really good days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, until he distilled and articulated it, that was unconscious
knowledge.  However, now that I know the &quot;trick,&quot; I try very much to
have very good days even though I have high expectations.</p>
<p>I'm very lucky: I get the runner's high as I run, which leads itself
to a profound sense of gratitude (but not quite in a drunken
slobbering &quot;I love you man&quot; repeated ad nauseum sense).</p>
<p>This section contains entries for groups (and eventually individuals)
that I'm thankful for.  It's just shy of paralyzingly intimidating to
start writing these entries, because it's going to take a long time
and I certainly don't want any group or person to feel left out.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdg"><a class="header" href="#agdg">AGDG</a></h1>
<p>I joined the <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game Developers Guild</a> in
the middle of 2021, but before that I had known one of the co-founders
for years and he's one of the friendliest people I know. Not
surprisingly, the group he co-founded is also welcoming.</p>
<p>When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so I'm not a complete rando crashing their party.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdgat"><a class="header" href="#agdgat">AGDGAT</a></h1>
<p>After the ADGD remote meeting finishes, a subset of members join for an
accountability meeting.  The premise is simple, each member briefly describes
the work that member did in the previous week, specifically compared to
the prediction that member made at the last meeting.  Congratulations,
sympathy, understanding and words of encouragement are provided and then
that member makes a prediction for the following week.  The predictions
are tracked on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this process, even though I've fallen short more times
than I've exceeded my goals.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="barge"><a class="header" href="#barge">BARGE</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE website</a> explains what BARGE is
better than I can.</p>
<p>I attended my first BARGE in 1994.</p>
<p>It was through BARGE that I learned about handheld GPS devices (thanks
Patti and Bingo!), which got me into hiking.</p>
<p>When I needed to have a medical procedure done in San Francisco, two
BARGErs (thanks Patti and Charles) put me up.</p>
<p>I ran my first mile (on July 22nd, 2009) in anticipation of the BARGE
Fun Run. I even wrote email to a running friend of mine and told her
that I had just run my first mile and I actually enjoyed it but that I
hadn't caught the running bug (hah!).</p>
<p>BARGE members tested multibot, my first poker server and are actively
using mb2, the poker server I wrote twenty years later.</p>
<p>I owe these people a lot!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="team-rwb-1"><a class="header" href="#team-rwb-1">Team RWB</a></h1>
<p>Team RWB is a veteran's service organization that provides
opportunities for veterans and the community to connect through
physical and social activity. I first became aware of them when I saw
people in Team RWB shirts helping a man navigate the <a href="https://bataanmarch.com/">Bataan Memorial
Death March</a> (BMDM) using a hand-cranked
vehicle to propel himself. His legs didn't function, but his arms did
and although I didn't know who they were at the time, it was clear he
had a most excellent support crew.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel room, I web searched Team RWB and learned
that they were open to civilians.  Eventually I decided to join because
my father served in the Air Force for twenty years and as an Air Force
brat I went to a few years of school on base. I figured I had a bit of
experience with the BMDM and perhaps I could help out some way.</p>
<p>Over the years our Albuquerque group has turned into a national
chapter through the great leadership of many captains. I'm lucky to
have found them and honored that they allow me to participate in their
various activities.</p>
