<p>Greetings. I'm <a href="https://www.builtinnm.org/people/20">Cliff Matthews</a>
(<a href="https://members.teamrwb.org/profile/9056">Team RWB</a>,
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205">Strava</a>), aka Clifford
Matthews
(<a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&amp;lname=Matthews">UltraSignup</a>),
aka deadhead (<a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>,
<a href="https://devctm.com/">devctm</a>, <a href="https://db.marathonmaniacs.com/Maniacs/myraces/4395">Marathon

aka ctm (<a href="https://github.com/ctm">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game
Developers Guild</a>) aka nmdeadhead

don't wear a tinfoil hat, I <em>am</em> concerned with privacy, albeit I'm
more concerned with yours than mine.</p>
<p>I don't participate in traditional social media. I do have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-matthews-4a44231/">LinkedIn
account</a>,
although I haven't done a good job of keeping it up to date. I don't
have a Facebook or Instagram account.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've tossed various random stuff into <a href="https://github.com/ctm?tab=repositories">public
repositories</a> in my GitHub
account. In 2016 I chose to publicly document <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2017.md">the
training</a>
I was planning on doing for the 2017 Bataan Memorial Death March. It
felt weird having so much info out there, but I did hear from others
who read it and appreciated that I made it available, so I've
continued that tradition and slowly added more info that people may or
may not find handy.</p>
<p>Before too long I'll be looking for investors in the company that I've
formed to monetize my poker software.  I figure investors are
potentially going to do some web sleuthing to find out more about me,
so putting a chunk of info here makes sense and it goes hand-in-hand
with doing post-running brain dumps that are kind of like a blog, but
done in mdbook (the format that this document is in).</p>
<p>Currently, on a typical week I run for a couple hours or more on
Mondays through Saturdays and ride my bike for several hours on
Sunday.  This gives me a lot of time to think and record voice notes.
I'm planning to dump some of my thoughts into this &quot;book&quot;.  It's kind
of like me writing up thoughts for a younger version of myself and
probably equally pointless.  I don't (yet!) have a time machine and
younger deadhead listened to nobody.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running"><a class="header" href="#running">Running</a></h1>
<p>I run a lot. I'm also the race director for the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/">Baldy
50k</a> and the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/chimney-melon-50k/">Chimney
Melon
50k</a>,
which are two of the events in the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/">Albuquerque Fat Ass
Series</a>.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Fat Ass Series is hosted (for free, thanks!) on
wordpress.com and as such it can't host the GPX files that
participants might want, so I host them here.</p>
<p>On Thursday, August 12th, 2021 <a href="http://www.abqroadrunners.com/uploads/6/7/7/6/6776981/arr_newsletter_2021.august.pdf">I gave</a>,
to the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road Runners</a>, a
brief presentation on my Hardrock 2021 experience. I had planned on writing
up the notes in this book and then using them to guide my presentation,
but instead I just had a few beers and talked everyone's ears off.  So,
I have to get into Hardrock again so I can do it right next time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="events-i-direct"><a class="header" href="#events-i-direct">Events I Direct</a></h1>
<p>I am a reluctant, exceedingly minimalist (lazy is my middle name), race
director.  I may get better as time goes on or I may shed my RD duties.
I certainly don't want to be a race director, per-se, but I don't want
the Baldy 50k to go away as long as there is still interest in it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chimney-melon-50k"><a class="header" href="#chimney-melon-50k">Chimney Melon 50k</a></h1>

50k</a> page by
providing the GPX files (that I can't server from wordpress.com) from
previous runnings of the CM50K.</p>
<p>Or, it will, when I get around to adding them here.</p>

previous runnings of the Baldy 50k.</p>
<p>I've run Baldy 50k several times, but so far, I've only uploaded three
of them to Strava.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from reviewing my paths on Strava, none of those
three have any significant wrong turns.  The ones from 2019 and 2020
have ridiculous elevation profiles though. They were made with an
ancient Ambit 3 that just does a horrible job with elevation.</p>

<p>However, I placed them here before I put them there, so I'm leaving
them here as well.  Normally people have to finish by 9pm for it to
count, but that rule was relaxed this year due to the excessive
blowdown.</p>
<p>George and I slowed down significantly on the way out to Johnson Lake
as we did some trail maintenance. We employed all sorts of tricks
(with no injuries in this universe) to improve things: primarily
moving, breaking, bending and kicking.  However, there was still more
blowdown that we couldn't improve than the amount we did improve. So,
I doubt anyone who came after us would even notice our handiwork.</p>
<p>The weather was very nice.  No thunder or lightning or even rain. It
was mostly overcast.  My truck claims it was 42F at about 7:30am and
51F at 8:20pm.</p>

<p>Wordpress free hosting is an excellent service, but they don't allow
GPX files to be downloaded directly.  There are other excellent free
sites, like <a href="https://www.trailrunproject.com/">trailrunproject.com</a>
that host GPX files, but require you to create a (free) account and
log-in to download them.</p>
<p>Most people are OK with using free accounts and the tracking that comes
with them to get useful information, but some aren't.  As such, not
only do I provide GPX files for the races I direct, I will also add
GPX files for other events so that people who wish not to be tracked
can download them.</p>

<p>Over the years I've participated in more than a couple of hundred events.
I often take notes to myself before and afterward; I've even written the
occasional event report and mailed it to a few friends.  Unless asked,
I don't plan on digging up any of that old information, but I will
take a stab at documenting my experiences here.</p>
<p>Although these reports are for me, if you have a question about
anything I've written here, <a href="mailto:clifford.t.matthews@gmail.com">send me
email</a>. Similarly, if you have a
question about any of the events I've participated in that I haven't
documented here, <a href="mailto:clifford.t.matthews@gmail.com">send me

events are listed on my <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&amp;lname=Matthews">UltraSignup

<p>This was the biggie, but I didn't take notes
at the time.  My excellent team comprised JE: crew chief, SB: JE's
right hand man, PL: pacer from Grouse (mile 42.2) to Telluride (mile
72.8) and MW: pacer from Telluride to the finish line.  They did all
the work. I just had to hike, walk and run in a big circle with their
assistance.</p>
<p>I will come back and fill this in sometime.</p>

twice prior: <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1579538">2019</a>
and <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1792746">2021</a>.  Both
times, I raced it so I could (and did!) qualify for the Boston
Marathon. It is a very downhill course, although the rollers starting
around mile 19 have slowed me down all three years.</p>
<p>This year, however, my truck died the day before and that
complicated my race.  Luckily, I'll be sixty years old by Boston
2023, so I only needed to run a 3:50 to qualify and I ran
<a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=7660499">3:25:32</a>.</p>
<p>This report is for my own benefit.  Although I remember the details
clearly as I write this, it won't be too long before I forget many of
the details.  My plan is to switch from running the Big Cottonwood
Marathon as a Boston Qualifier to running the Tucson marathon.  My
MSCS advisor has moved to Tucson and running that race would be a good
excuse to visit him.  Additionally, Aravaipa puts on a good event.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-albuquerque-to-moab"><a class="header" href="#thursday-albuquerque-to-moab">Thursday: Albuquerque to Moab</a></h2>
<p>I left Albuquerque around the time I thought I'd need to leave in
order to arrive at <a href="https://moabkitchen.com/">Moab Kitchen</a> around
4pm, i.e., just as they were opening.  I love Moab Kitchen and I also
found a great campsite just north of there last year that I was looking
forward to returning to.</p>
<p>I did indeed get there shortly after four. I ate some food, made a
business call, caught up on my email and was about to drive to the
<a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#geminibridges">Gemini Bridges Road
campground</a>
when I remembered that the last time I had tried to use four-wheel
drive I had trouble shifting it in and out. So, instead of waiting
until I absolutely had to have 4WD, I decided to check it in the Moab
Kitchen parking lot. Uh oh. Not only was it exceedingly hard for me to
get it into 4-Low, I basically couldn't get it, unassisted, back into
2WD.</p>
<p>After texting some friends for advice, I tried rocking the truck back
and forth, and finally I got it into 2WD.  Dodged a bullet!  Gemini
Bridges was out, so I chose to go to <a href="https://campnado.com/dispersed-camping-moab/#klondikebluffs">Klondike Bluffs
Road</a>
instead. My truck sounded a little funny as I was driving, but I was
harried and there may have been grooves in the asphalt.  I couldn't
figure out if I was imagining things.</p>
<p>I set up my tent, read a bit of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29359067-presto-how-i-made-over-100-pounds-disappear-and-other-magical-tales">Presto!</a>,
then went to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork"><a class="header" href="#friday-morning-moab-to-spanish-fork">Friday morning: Moab to Spanish Fork</a></h2>
<p>I woke up at my normal time and kicked myself for not having joined
AAA.  My buddy Jason's truck's radiator catastrophically failed a
couple weeks prior. He had to pay a huge bill to get his truck towed.
At the time, I had mentioned that I keep meaning to sign up for AAA
(my truck is a 1998 with more than 200,000 miles on it), but I always
forget. So, although it would have been better to have signed up well
before heading out from Albuquerque, I used my phone as a hot-spot and
joined AAA.</p>
<p>The noise I thought I had heard while driving the previous night had
disappeared, or perhaps it had never been there or maybe even I had
gotten accustomed to it. Regardless, other than running way too low on
gas and having to pay around $6/gallon to get a few gallons at a
remote gas station, the drive went well until I my truck failed to
drive when the stoplight I was at turned green.</p>
<p>I was in the left-most of three non-turning lanes on highway six in
Spanish Fork.  I put my hazards on, then tried putting the truck in
neutral and pushing it out of the way.  It moved a little before it
stopped and couldn't be pushed.  Not by me solo and not when three
large men volunteered to help.  The transmission was fried and nothing
I did helped.</p>
<p>I tried to arrange a tow through AAA but their system didn't work well,
so it literally took hours while I interacted with them.  Eventually
my truck was towed to Tunex in nearby Springville.  The Tunex people
were nice and understanding, but not only did they need to diagnose
the problem, they also had to find a replacement transfer case and
drive-train so they could get me a quote.  It was not going to be
cheap, nor would it be done soon.</p>
<h2 id="friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel"><a class="header" href="#friday-afternoon-spanish-fork-to-packet-pickup-and-the-hotel">Friday afternoon: Spanish Fork to packet pickup and the hotel</a></h2>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a car in Springville that I could rent for
a day at <a href="https://turo.com/">Turo</a>.  Sometime around 5pm, I was able
to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7792735587">jog over to the rental
car</a>, drive back to
Tunex, grab a bunch of stuff from my truck (including my food; I had
chosen to drive north in a fasted state, because I figured I'd eat
in the packet pickup parking lot around noon), then drive to packet
pickup which was going to close at 7pm.</p>
<p>There was at least one accident that caused the freeway to crawl to a
halt.  I think there were actually two.  It was a bit nerve-racking
both because I needed to get to packet pickup by 7, but I certainly
didn't want to get into a fender bender.</p>
<p>I made it to packet pickup around 6pm and then got checked in to the
Residence Inn around 7pm.  I had not yet eaten that day.  I had
previously planned on what I would eat and when, but that all got
thrown out the door when my truck died. I wound up eating about <a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/blob/master/log/2022.txt#L10604-L10608">3,000
calories of
food</a>
(including the highish-fiber oatmeal that was supposed to be my
post-race recovery food) in an hour or so and going to bed.</p>
<h2 id="race-day-pre-race"><a class="header" href="#race-day-pre-race">Race Day, pre-race</a></h2>
<p>My alarm woke me up at 3:15 and I drank a double espresso.  I think I had
fallen asleep around 9:30, so almost six hours.  Had the previous day not
been so hectic, <em>my guess</em> is I'd have fallen asleep about an hour earlier
(and had my final calories several hours before that).</p>
<p>I had a little food at the hotel before the hotel buses drove us to the
start.  I immediately headed to the porta-potties and kept walking all
the way to the end of them and the last one was unused. Yay.</p>
<p>I put on my sweatpants and a sweatshirt and wrapped myself in the space
blanket from packet pickup.  I killed time by reading a book written by
the daughter of a Bataan Death March survivor.  Around 6:15 (I think),
I drank a double espresso. Sometime around then I also ate some basmati
rice and took two 200mg ibuprofen tablets.</p>
<p>Initially I had planned on only taking 200mg pre-race and 200mg at the
halfway point, but I had forgotten to do laundry before getting ready
to leave Albuquerque, so I didn't have a lot of clean socks.  I did,
however, have a clean pair of very thin socks.  I also didn't have any
low-mileage road shoes, so I chose the Torin pair with around 850
miles on them (as opposed to my other pair with over 1,400) and
decided the combination of ancient shoes and thin socks merited
additional analgesics.</p>
<h3 id="poor-porta-potty-position"><a class="header" href="#poor-porta-potty-position">Poor Porta-Potty Position</a></h3>
<p>The very trick that allowed me to get an open porta-potty fresh off
the bus worked against me this time.  Thinking I had plenty of time, I
got in the closest porta-potty line to where I had been sitting.  That
was the left-most line. When there is a row of N porta-potties and N
is large enough (e.g., eight or more), people at the head of any given
line then typically advance to the first of up to three porta-potties
ahead of them, specifically the one directly in front of them and one
to either side.</p>
<p>The upside of one person having the choice of three porta-potties is
that it lessens the chance of a line being completely held up by
someone taking a longer than usual time in a potty.  It does, however,
require each person at the head of the line paying attention to make
sure that each line is still moving more-or-less fairly. The downside
is that a line can stall if the person at the head of that line
doesn't understand this de facto protocol, is distracted or simply
doesn't want to take any stall except the one directly in front.</p>
<p>All else equal, the lines at either end of a row of porta-potties will
move at two-thirds the speed of the interior lines, because the person
at the head of the line will only have two porta-potties to choose
from, while the person at the head of an interior line has three.  I
knew this, but still chose to stand in the left-most line, figuring
that since I had plenty of time, two-thirds speed would get me in and
out with room to spare.  I was wrong.</p>
<p>The line I was in stalled.  I think the person at the head of the line
not only wasn't considering the diagonal stall as a possible choice, but
he also wasn't noticing that people from the adjacent line were taking
the stall in front of him repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="drawstring-disaster"><a class="header" href="#drawstring-disaster">Drawstring Disaster</a></h3>
<p>It had been cool enough that I had chosen to not take off my pre-run
outer layer, so I still had my pre-race bag with me, and the drop off
for that was back up the hill.  I decided it was more important to
pack my bag and get it dropped off and get back to the start line than
attempt to take another poop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I went to tie up my bag, the string broke.  I asked
the person shoveling bags into the truck if he had a spare bag, but he
didn't and directed me further up the hill.  I went all the way up and
nope, nobody up there had spare bags either, but there were several people
who also had broken strings.</p>
<p>I extracted the two pieces of string from the drawstring portion of the bag,
tied them together and then asked a woman for assistance.  She offered to
tie my bag while I held it, but I politely asked her to hold the bag while
I tied it so that if it came undone and I lost anything (and my phone and
wallet were in the bag!), I'd only have myself to blame.</p>
<p>I then descended to the bag-drop truck and handed them my bag and found my
place in line. With little fanfare, the race started at 6:45.</p>
<h2 id="the-race-itself"><a class="header" href="#the-race-itself">The Race itself</a></h2>
<p>Waiting in line for the race to start I was a little concerned by the
possibility of my bag either opening and disgorging some of its
contents or losing the tie that had my bib number.</p>
<p>If the bag was intact, but without a bib number, would I be able to
find it? Probably; they'd presumably set it aside and I could identify
it, or perhaps they'd open it and find my wallet. Similarly, if my
wallet or phone slipped out, I'd probably be able to reclaim them,
too.</p>
<p>Before the race started I felt like I probably <em>could</em> poop if given
the chance, but I didn't feel like I <em>needed</em> to.</p>
<p>Once I crossed the starting line, all my anxiety disappeared.  The
initial downhill grade is steep enough that it takes me a little
effort and concentration to adjust my cadence and stride so I'm
getting the &quot;free downhill&quot;, not fighting it, but also not running out
of control.</p>
<p>Before the race had begun, I was chatting with another runner and he
mentioned that the aid stations would have gels.  With that in mind, I
lightened my expandable waistband by removing five of the seven gels I
had, figuring I'd just take them from the aid station. I think that
was the right thing to do, but it did mean that my gel consumption was
less predictable, because not all aid stations. I would have known
that had I researched it pre-race, since it was <a href="https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/info#aid">well
documented</a> on the Big
Cottonwood Marathon website.</p>
<h3 id="bam"><a class="header" href="#bam">Bam!</a></h3>
<p>About nineteen miles in, I knew I had to take a porta-potty break to
poop. As I feared, eating as much as I did the prior evening caught up
with me. I was in and out fairly quickly, but a bit distracted as I
tried to tie my running short drawstring as I ran.  I was still
running a little to the right (i.e., where the porta-potties had been)
of the road when I tripped and hit fairly hard.</p>
<p>My left knee took the brunt of the impact, but I also managed to
scrape my right knee and bloody my right palm. I was able to get back
up almost immediately and resume running.  I had taken an additional
400mg of ibuprofen at mile 13 and by now it was kicking in, so I
didn't have that much discomfort and didn't limp, per-se, but my gait
was slightly affected.</p>
<h2 id="excuses-excuses"><a class="header" href="#excuses-excuses">Excuses, excuses</a></h2>
<p>This year I was three minutes and sixteen seconds slower than last
year, but my average heart rate was ten beats per minute slower.  I
think that had I been able to eat on the day before like I had planned
and gotten to sleep when I planned, I wouldn't have needed the
porta-potty. I also think that I slowed a little before I resigned
myself to making that stop and I suspect that had I not made the
porta-potty stop I wouldn't have fallen.</p>
<p>So, did my truck's death the day before prevent me from PR'ing? Maybe.
On the other hand, it took me 1:29:50 to get to mile 12 this year and
only 1:28:08 to get there the year before.  Mile 12 was long before I
took the porta-potty break, so presumably I wasn't slowed as much by
GI distress and definitely wasn't slowed by the fall (that hadn't yet
occurred) in my first 12 miles.  On the other hand, last year my heart-rate
was around 150bpm at mile 12, but only around 135bpn at mile 12.  My
average HR was still around 150bpm on my 24th mile last year, but had only
crept up to 140bpm by during my 24th mile this year. I believe my HR data
suggests I was being held back a bit at the end, but I'll never know.</p>
<p>FWIW, had I finished fifteen seconds earlier, I'd have been 3rd in my age
group. I'd need to take off an <em>additional</em> five minutes and seventeen
seconds to have taken 2nd AG and another six seconds after that to have
been first in my age group this year. No truck problems probably would
have given me 3rd AG. I think 2nd or 1st AG would have been a coin-flip.</p>

<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/aa50k/">AA 50k</a> is a night race
(starting at 7pm on a Friday) that normally consists of up to ten 3.3
mile loops around Albuquerque Academy.  It is open to people who wish
to do fewer. Back when we had thirty or so people starting, after
people had finished they'd be put in the division for the number of
laps they had completed and then, within that division, ranked based
on their finishing time.</p>
<p>It may be time to retire this race. We only had three starters: Jason Romero,
Mark Werkmeister and myself. Jason and I finished 31 miles seconds less
than eight hours.</p>
<h2 id="the-race"><a class="header" href="#the-race">The &quot;Race&quot;</a></h2>
<p>Mark was planning on doing <em>at most</em> four laps (i.e., a half
marathon), but complication from his recent surgery limited his
participation to a little more than two laps (a bit more than a 10k).
Furthermore, Mark has not yet been cleared to run, so he was walking,
so Jason, Mark and I walked together initially.</p>
<p>About four tenths of a mile into his third loop, Mark let prudence 
turn him back toward his car so he could drive home. Although he had
been cleared by his doctor to walk and hike, his body was acting up
and telling him to stop. He listened.</p>
<p>Being lazy, Jason and I accompanied Mark back to his car before restarting
our third loop.  You might think that would have caused us to do an extra
eight tenths of a mile, but instead we decided to do only nine complete
laps, since with all the futzing around, we were at 31.03 miles by then.</p>
<p>Although we stuck together, my GPS watch said my time was
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7857963617">7:59:45</a>, whereas
Jason's said his time was 7:59:47, so I stole the win!</p>
<h2 id="what-was-i-doing"><a class="header" href="#what-was-i-doing">What was I doing?</a></h2>
<p>I took this event for granted.  I knew Mark was going to be there and was
going to be walking a few loops. I also knew that earlier in the year I had
run the Cedro Peak 50k in a fasted state until the final three aid stations,
where I had a beer at each. So, I figured I could just show up, walk a few
laps with Mark, not pay much attention to my caloric intake and then run
the remaining laps after Mark was done and call it a night.</p>
<p>Turns out, Mark walks much faster than I do. He always has.  He is
taller that I am, but I suspect his natural stride is a greater
percentage of his height than mine, so at what appeared to be the same
cadence, it was hard for me to keep up without running, but my pride
didn't want me to run. I did, however want to stay near him, in order
to make chatting easier, so for the first lap and change I walked
faster than was comfortable and found myself getting tired and hungry!</p>
<p>It was a bit demoralizing to be tired and hungry after a lap and a
half when I thought I was going to breeze through the first few laps,
but the tiredness was not muscular tiredness, it was a combination of
sleepy tiredness and my body saying &quot;why are you walking at an
unnaturally fast pace when you could be running?&quot;  My guess is the
hunger was because I wasn't exerting myself enough to get my body
burning fat.</p>
<p>At some point, and I think it was after our second lap, I drank one of
my emergency double espressos.  I also ate a big hunk of (perhaps
slightly spoiled) sweet potato.  When Mark called it an early night,
my mental focus turned to his situation and even though I knew he
wasn't having an emergency, I was still hit hard by the fact that his
body was mean enough to make him quit so early.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-two-of-us"><a class="header" href="#just-the-two-of-us">Just the two of us</a></h2>
<p>Before too long, Jason and I fell into hundred-miler mode where we were
hiking the uphill leg of the loop and running the downhill leg and the
two relatively neutral legs.</p>
<p>I wound up with some GI distress both from a combination of what I had
eaten earlier in the day and <em>perhaps</em> the state of the sweet potato.
I had brought a &quot;bucket potty&quot; and kept planning on using it, but I really
didn't want to and my urge to go would disappear as I was hiking and the
bucket potty was where our cars were and we typically hiked that section.</p>
<p>By the time we had finished our sixth lap it was clear that we'd only
need to do nine complete laps this year, so I gave myself something to
look forward to at the end of each of the remaining laps: I was going
to attempt to use to bucket potty at the end of the seventh; I was
going to drink a beer at the end of the eighth and the end of the
ninth would be the finish, which would allow me to drive home where I
had a real toilet and more beer!</p>
<h2 id="glad-i-went"><a class="header" href="#glad-i-went">Glad I went</a></h2>
<p>It was great to see Mark.  It's always good to see Jason too, but we
had spent a fair amount of time together two weeks prior when I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7717983430">paced
him the last 50 miles</a>
of the <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=89185#id437178">Creede
100</a>.
I hadn't seen Mark since before his operation, when he, Jason and I
did a &quot;<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7595451430">shortest double
crossing</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="aa-50k-origin"><a class="header" href="#aa-50k-origin">AA 50k Origin</a></h2>
<p>AA 50k was added to the <a href="https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/">Albuquerque Fat Ass
series</a> in 2012 to give people
training for their first hundred miler a chance to run in the dark on
a familiar, accessible, tame, course.</p>
<h2 id="aa-50k-future"><a class="header" href="#aa-50k-future">AA 50k Future</a></h2>
<p>There's no longer a <em>need</em> for AA 50k, so perhaps 2022 was its final
year.  The people for whom AA 50k was initially set up for now have a
decade of night running experience.  However, hundred milers continue
to gain popularity and there's a new stable of runners who might want
the stepping stone that AA 50k can provide.  If it is to be put on in
2023, a date will be chosen much
earlier and more will be done to increase attendance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tour-of-the-rio-grande-2022"><a class="header" href="#tour-of-the-rio-grande-2022">Tour of the Rio Grande 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.torgbc.com/">Tour of the Rio Grande</a> is a bicycle event
that offers many different ride distances.  I chose to ride the
Century (100 miles). I had done this event in 2019 and wanted to do it
again, but it wasn't offered in 2020 and although it reappeared in
2021, it escaped my notice.  As centuries go, it's fairly easy in that
there's very little elevation change, but it's well done and is
surprisingly social considering the fact that they don't have a
post-ride beer garden.</p>
<p>It's not a race andâ€”<em>temporarily</em>â€”being short of cash, I
chose to use the rest stop food rather than use Tailwind in my water
bottles.  That meant I stopped five times.  I'm also a big baby when
it comes to traffic, so I took a lot more time
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7867294235">6:49:23</a>) to finish
this supported 100 mile ride than I did on my last unsupported rest
day 100 miler
(<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7298799302">6:07:31</a>).</p>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>I chose to ride ToRG for a few reasons. </p>
<p>One is that my brother-in-law has gotten into biking and he and I were
going to ride some centuries this year, but he got injured. So,
although our centuries together are deferred to next year, I was
already looking forward to &quot;them&quot;.  In reality, although <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7187704802">I
rode</a> the <a href="https://www.santafecentury.com/">Santa Fe
Century</a> earlier this year, I
probably won't be riding the <a href="https://dayofthetread.com/">Day of the
Tread</a> Century a month from now, because
it conflicts with the <a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/">Albuquerque Road
Runners</a> &quot;<a href="https://www.abqroadrunners.com/forever-young-run.html">Forever
Young</a>&quot;
footrace.</p>
<p>Two, in theory, I run six days week and ride my bike on Sundays.  In
reality, I often skip the bike ride because I'm a fair weather rider,
especially after going over the handlebars due to me overly applying
the break when coming up on black ice.  Today, however, was good weather,
so sure!</p>
<p>Three, I plan on running the Tortugas Mountain 24 hour race in Las
Cruces on a Friday evening before returning to Albuquerque and then
being the five hour pace group leader for the Duke City Marathon on
the following Sunday, so by &quot;running&quot; (cough!) the AA 50k on Friday
evening and then riding the Tour of the Rio Grande the following
Sunday, I was able to make sure that the timing worked.</p>
<h2 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h2>
<h3 id="off-course-briefly"><a class="header" href="#off-course-briefly">Off course briefly</a></h3>
<p>Before the tour started, I ran into my friend Bill Dyea from search
and rescue.  We chatted a bit which was nice, but perhaps I should
have used a little of that time to review the cue sheet, because I did
miss one turn, the one going back east on Rio Bravo.</p>
<p>When I got to that intersection, I thought I was supposed to turn, but
I looked carefully and didn't see any signs.  Perhaps there was no
sign, because the turn is &quot;obvious&quot;, but I wasn't sure if there was a
&quot;backdoor&quot; route that avoided Rio Bravo in the early afternoon when it
was really busy.  It's also possible that there had been a sign and it
was removed or that it was still there and I just didn't look in the
right place.</p>
<p>So, without seeing a sign and having a green light, I crossed Rio
Bravo. But shortly after getting to the other side I stopped, got my
bicycle out of traffic, turned on my phone, brought the course up on
Gaia, saw that I made a mistake, then backtracked back to Rio Bravo
and got back on course.</p>
<h3 id="trains-werent-bad-this-year"><a class="header" href="#trains-werent-bad-this-year">Trains weren't bad this year</a></h3>
<p>Unlike three years ago, I only had to wait briefly at a train track crossing.
There was indeed a train on the rails when I got to the infamous crossing,
but it was a relatively short train and half of it had already passed.</p>
<h3 id="roadkill-was"><a class="header" href="#roadkill-was">Roadkill was</a></h3>
<p>There was a ton of roadkill out.  I must have seen at least a half
dozen dead raccoons, two or three skunks, a couple of dead porcupines
and even a coyote.  Although I don't recall seeing as much roadkill
three years ago, two data points isn't enough to draw any conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked"><a class="header" href="#signs-definitely-could-be-overlooked">Signs definitely could be overlooked</a></h3>
<p>Other than perhaps a sign marking the Rio Bravo turn, I didn't miss
any signs that marked the course, but many people did miss the turn
for the first aid station.  That aid station is at the Las Lunas
Railrunner (the local &quot;commuter&quot; train) station, but you have to take
a left turn (on the way out) to get there.  It's at about mile
nineteen, but luckily (for the people who missed it), the second aid
station is at about mile 31.</p>
<h3 id="bad-drunk-driver"><a class="header" href="#bad-drunk-driver">Bad (drunk?) Driver</a></h3>
<p>As I was north riding on Isleta and approaching Gun Club, I saw a driver
turn left from Gun Club and swing so far into the bike lane that his tires
were inches from hitting the curb.  The driver then overcompensated and
swung past the left boundary of the lane before eventually settling into
the middle.  I was in no danger of being hit, because I was well behind,
and I doubt that the driver would have swung that wide had I been in the
way, because a bicyclist is larger than a curb, but â€¦ drivers still
scare me.</p>
<h3 id="too-much-caffeine"><a class="header" href="#too-much-caffeine">Too much caffeine</a></h3>
<p>Knowing that I was going to be stopping at all the aid stations and
that traffic (potentially including a train) might also slow me down,
I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to finish the ride in
the allotted seven hours, so â€¦ I drank a quad espresso just
before starting and another quad espresso at mile 50.  Perhaps that
was not a good choice, because I'm going to have a fair amount of
trouble sleeping at my normal time tonight.</p>
<h3 id="knee-held-up-nicely"><a class="header" href="#knee-held-up-nicely">Knee held up nicely</a></h3>
<p>I had injured my left knee when I fell at the Big Cottonwood Marathon
fifteen days ago.  My knee didn't give me any trouble at the AA 50k
Friday evening and it didn't give me any trouble on this century.
However, <em>right now</em> about seven hours after finishing, my knee is
complaining.</p>
<h3 id="music-as-a-crutch"><a class="header" href="#music-as-a-crutch">Music as a crutch</a></h3>
<p>ToRG doesn't allow people to ride with earbuds.  I don't think I'd
have used them even if I were allowed, because there's enough traffic
that I <em>really</em> want to be able to hear the cars behind me.  However,
this ride did suggest to me that I rely on the beat of music to speed
me up.  In the future, I should take that into consideration.</p>

<h2 id="three-training-blocks"><a class="header" href="#three-training-blocks">Three training blocks</a></h2>
<p>For the last several years, I've had three distinct training blocks
per year.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fun Around</li>
<li>Bataan Memorial Death March</li>
<li>Hardrock (or qualifier)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm currently in my &quot;fun around&quot; training block; it ends in mid
November.  During this block I participate in a lot of events, but
actually race in very few.</p>
<p>After that I am in a <a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March">serious training
block</a> for the
Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM).  I have relatively few events
during my BMDM block and do serious ruck training two and a half days
a week.</p>
<p>My final block leads up to Hardrock (if I get in) or a qualifier (for
2023, Ehunmilak) if I don't.  After that, I'm back to a &quot;fun around&quot;
block.</p>
<h2 id="events-ill-probably-participate-in"><a class="header" href="#events-ill-probably-participate-in">Events I'll Probably Participate In</a></h2>
<p>Although my schedule for the rest of 2022 is fairly well defined, many
of the 2023 events I hope to participate in have not yet been
announced or involve a lottery that I must win in order to get into.</p>
<p>Additionally, my participation is predicated on me successfully
launching <a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a>, which looks
promising, but is certainly not a given.  Craftpoker.com's
shareholders are my highest priority, however, my running and rucking
seem to help me at work.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Wylie_Hubbard">Ray Wylie Hubbard</a>
closes his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w">Mother
Blues</a> with the words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the days that I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations, I
have really good days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, until he distilled and articulated it, that was unconscious
knowledge.  However, now that I know the &quot;trick,&quot; I try very much to
have very good days even though I have high expectations.</p>
<p>I'm very lucky: I get the runner's high as I run, which leads itself
to a profound sense of gratitude (but not quite in a drunken
slobbering &quot;I love you man&quot; repeated ad nauseum sense).</p>
<p>This section contains entries for groups (and eventually individuals)
that I'm thankful for.  It's just shy of paralyzingly intimidating to
start writing these entries, because it's going to take a long time
and I certainly don't want any group or person to feel left out.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdg"><a class="header" href="#agdg">AGDG</a></h1>
<p>I joined the <a href="https://agdg.co/">Albuquerque Game Developers Guild</a> in
the middle of 2021, but before that I had known one of the co-founders
for years and he's one of the friendliest people I know. Not
surprisingly, the group he co-founded is also welcoming.</p>
<p>When covid hit, a lot of the Albuquerque meetups slowly died. AGDG has
an active discord server and weekly remote meetings.  I don't consider
myself a game developer, per-se, but poker is a game and I am a
developer, so I'm not a complete rando crashing their party.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agdgat"><a class="header" href="#agdgat">AGDGAT</a></h1>
<p>After the ADGD remote meeting finishes, a subset of members join for an
accountability meeting.  The premise is simple, each member briefly describes
the work that member did in the previous week, specifically compared to
the prediction that member made at the last meeting.  Congratulations,
sympathy, understanding and words of encouragement are provided and then
that member makes a prediction for the following week.  The predictions
are tracked on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this process, even though I've fallen short more times
than I've exceeded my goals.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="barge"><a class="header" href="#barge">BARGE</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE website</a> explains what BARGE is
better than I can.</p>
<p>I attended my first BARGE in 1994.</p>
<p>It was through BARGE that I learned about handheld GPS devices (thanks
Patti and Bingo!), which got me into hiking.</p>
<p>When I needed to have a medical procedure done in San Francisco, two
BARGErs (thanks Patti and Charles) put me up.</p>
<p>I ran my first mile (on July 22nd, 2009) in anticipation of the BARGE
Fun Run. I even wrote email to a running friend of mine and told her
that I had just run my first mile and I actually enjoyed it but that I
hadn't caught the running bug (hah!).</p>
<p>BARGE members tested multibot, my first poker server and are actively
using mb2, the poker server I wrote twenty years later.</p>
<p>I owe these people a lot!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="team-rwb"><a class="header" href="#team-rwb">Team RWB</a></h1>
<p>Team RWB is a veteran's service organization that provides
opportunities for veterans and the community to connect through
physical and social activity. I first became aware of them when I saw
people in Team RWB shirts helping a man navigate the <a href="https://bataanmarch.com/">Bataan Memorial
Death March</a> (BMDM) using a hand-cranked
vehicle to propel himself. His legs didn't function, but his arms did
and although I didn't know who they were at the time, it was clear he
had a most excellent support crew.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel room, I web searched Team RWB and learned
that they were open to civilians.  Eventually I decided to join because
my father served in the Air Force for twenty years and as an Air Force
brat I went to a few years of school on base. I figured I had a bit of
experience with the BMDM and perhaps I could help out some way.</p>
<p>Over the years our Albuquerque group has turned into a national
chapter through the great leadership of many captains. I'm lucky to
have found them and honored that they allow me to participate in their
various activities.</p>
